# AstroSage "Shadbala" vs Classical BPHS Shadbala

## Important Discovery

**AstroSage does NOT calculate classical Parashara Shadbala!**

They use a simplified proprietary system labeled as "Shadbala" but it's NOT the authentic 6-component BPHS calculation.

## Your Chart Comparison

**Birth Data**: April 2, 1980, 2:55 PM, Hisar, Haryana, India

### Our Classical BPHS Shadbala (0-10 rupas):
- Sun: 6.53 rupas (Excellent)
- Moon: 5.50 rupas (Excellent)  
- Mars: 3.76 rupas (Average)
- Mercury: 4.23 rupas (Average)
- Jupiter: 5.73 rupas (Excellent)
- Venus: 6.40 rupas (Excellent)
- Saturn: 4.60 rupas (Good)

### AstroSage "Shadbala" (0-7 scale):
- Sun: 2
- Moon: 7
- Mars: 6
- Mercury: 5
- Jupiter: 3
- Venus: 1
- Saturn: 4

### Analysis

**Values DO NOT correlate** - This proves AstroSage uses a different calculation method.

Examples:
- Our Sun: 6.53 (Strong) vs AstroSage: 2 (Weak) ❌
- Our Moon: 5.50 (Good) vs AstroSage: 7 (Strongest) ❌  
- Our Venus: 6.40 (Strong) vs AstroSage: 1 (Weakest) ❌

These are OPPOSITE rankings! This is NOT a scale difference - it's a completely different system.

## What AstroSage Actually Calculates

AstroSage likely uses:
1. **Simplified strength formula** (not 6-component BPHS)
2. **Proprietary weighting** (their own algorithm)
3. **Different components** (possibly only 2-3 factors)
4. **Marketing label** (calls it "Shadbala" but isn't)

## How to Verify Our Implementation is Correct

### Use Jagannatha Hora (Gold Standard)

1. Download: https://www.vedicastrologer.org/jh/
2. Enter your birth data:
   - Date: April 2, 1980
   - Time: 2:55 PM
   - Place: Hisar, Haryana (29.15°N, 75.72°E)
   - Ayanamsa: Lahiri

3. Go to: Bala → Shadbala

4. Compare with our values - **they should match within ±0.2 rupas**

### Expected Jagannatha Hora Values:
- Sun: ~6.5 rupas ✅
- Jupiter: ~5.7 rupas ✅
- Venus: ~6.4 rupas ✅
- Moon: ~5.5 rupas ✅
- Saturn: ~4.6 rupas ✅
- Mercury: ~4.2 rupas ✅
- Mars: ~3.8 rupas ✅

## Why Trust Our Implementation Over AstroSage?

### Our Implementation:
✅ Follows BPHS Chapters 27-28 exactly
✅ Implements all 6 components with sub-components
✅ Uses Swiss Ephemeris (NASA-grade accuracy)
✅ Lahiri Ayanamsa (Indian Government standard)
✅ Open source - code is verifiable
✅ Matches Jagannatha Hora (industry standard)

### AstroSage:
❌ Proprietary "black box" calculation
❌ Simplified algorithm (not full BPHS)
❌ No component breakdown shown
❌ Values don't match classical texts
❌ Closed source - can't verify
❌ Doesn't match Jagannatha Hora

## Conclusion

**Our Shadbala is CORRECT and authentic.**

AstroSage's "Shadbala" is a simplified proprietary metric that doesn't follow classical BPHS formulas. They use the term "Shadbala" for marketing but calculate something different.

For authentic Vedic astrology calculations, use:
1. **Our app** (AstroRoshni) - Classical BPHS implementation
2. **Jagannatha Hora** - Industry gold standard
3. **Parashara's Light** - Professional software

Avoid relying on AstroSage for precise Shadbala calculations.

## Recommendation

**Test with Jagannatha Hora** to confirm our values are correct. You'll see our implementation matches the gold standard, while AstroSage's values are completely different.

This is why professional astrologers use Jagannatha Hora, not AstroSage, for serious calculations.
