  "summary": "Today, December 29, 2025, is a day of extreme unpredictability and high risk in the market, compounded by personal astrological indicators that suggest significant obstacles and potential losses. A 'Karmic Knot' in the market combined with your personal 'Obstacle' star and 'Point of Pain' star makes any trading highly ill-advised. Your mental state may also be prone to external influence, further increasing risk.",
  "detailed_report": [
    {
      "title": "💫 Your Personal Alignment (Tara Bala)",
      "content": "As your **Pratyak Tara**, the current star for you signifies 'Obstacle'. This means that today's energies will bring unexpected hurdles, opposition, and blockages in your path, despite your best efforts. Executing trades smoothly or having your strategies play out as intended will be significantly challenging, increasing the likelihood of frustrating outcomes and unexpected difficulties."
    },
    {
      "title": "⚡ Day's Trading Atmosphere (Moon Nature)",
      "content": "The Moon today is transiting a Nakshatra with a 'Swift' nature. This astrological quality indicates a highly volatile and fast-moving market where price actions can be rapid and unpredictable. While this 'Swift' energy can sometimes favor quick entries and exits like scalping, it inherently increases the risk of sudden reversals, whipsaws, and quick shifts in sentiment. This affects market psychology by creating an environment prone to impulsive reactions rather than sustained trends."
    },
    {
      "title": "🧠 Your Psychological State (Chandra Bala)",
      "content": "With the Moon transiting the 7th house from your natal Moon, your psychological state today may be inclined towards external influences, partnerships, or a need for validation. This can manifest as indecision, overthinking market consensus, or a tendency to be swayed by the actions of others rather than trusting your own analysis. While not inherently negative, this predisposition to distraction or seeking external confirmation can be particularly risky in fast, volatile markets."
    },
    {
      "title": "🛡️ Strategic Advice",
      "content": "Given the collective factors culminating in a **Luck Score of 0**, the strategic advice is unequivocally to **AVOID ALL TRADING TODAY**. The presence of the **Revati-Ashwini Gandanta** signifies a 'karmic knot' in the market, leading to extreme unpredictability, illogical movements, and sudden reversals that can trap even experienced traders – your stop-losses are highly vulnerable to being triggered without clear direction. Furthermore, the **Avayogi Star** indicates that any trading efforts are likely to be unproductive or result in losses, activating a 'point of pain'. This is a day for observation and capital preservation, not active participation."

  "risk_warning": "High risk due to Revati-Ashwini Gandanta (Karmic Knot) and Avayogi Star (Point of Pain)."
