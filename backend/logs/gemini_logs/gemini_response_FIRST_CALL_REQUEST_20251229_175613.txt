================================================================================
Based on your birth chart and the current planetary movements, here is the analysis of your friendship karma.

<div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **Saturn-Rahu period (2025-2028)** brings a mix of high-status connections and sudden social turbulence. Specifically, while **Venus in your 11th House** gifts you loyal, artistic, and wealthy friends for life, the presence of **Gulika** there indicates hidden envy within your circle. Your inner strength (D9) is moderate here, meaning you often feel lonely even when surrounded by people. **Action:** Between **September 2025 and July 2026**, be extremely careful with lending money to friends, as the stars indicate a high risk of broken trust.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Royal Court" Dynamic:** Your 11th House (Friendship) contains **Venus in its Own Sign (Taurus)**. This is a primary strength. You naturally attract women, artists, financial experts, and people of "quality" rather than just a large quantity of random acquaintances.
*   **The Hidden Envy (The Challenge):** Despite the good placement, **Gulika** (a shadow point) sits with Venus. This creates a specific pattern: friends who smile to your face but harbor secret jealousy or competition.
*   **The "Crowded Mind" (Moon Analysis):** While your physical chart shows stable friends, your Moon chart (11th from Moon) contains a massive **4-planet conjunction (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Rahu)**. This means you emotionally experience your social life as intense, chaotic, and sometimes overwhelming.
*   **Jaimini Confirmation:** The current **Aquarius Chara Dasha** activates your 8th house (transformation), creating a period where social circles are being "pruned" or changed rapidly.

### Astrological Analysis

#### 1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)
Your chart shows a classic **Dhana Yoga** through friendship. With **Venus in the 11th House (Taurus)**, your network is your net worth. You are designed to benefit from social connections, particularly through females or luxury-related contacts.
*   **Ashtakavarga Strength:** Your 11th House has **31 Bindus** (High Strength). This confirms that friends are generally a source of gain and support, not a drain on your resources, provided you manage the boundaries.

#### 2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)
You are currently in the **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha** (approx. 2025-2028).
*   **Saturn** is in your 2nd house (Leo) with **Rahu**.
*   **The Effect:** Rahu amplifies the 2nd house (speech/values) and aspects the 6th and 10th. While not hitting the 11th directly, Rahu in Leo creates a "smoke and mirrors" effect in your social inner circle. You may attract "unconventional" or "foreign" friends during this time who seem exciting but may not be reliable.

#### 3. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
This timeline is confirmed by the **Aquarius** Chara Dasha (active until April 2026). Aquarius is your 8th House (Change). The 11th from Aquarius is Sagittarius, which is ruled by Jupiter. Since Jupiter is involved in the <term id="planetary_war">Planetary War</term> in Leo, your social network is currently undergoing a "stress test."
*   Additionally, the **Yogini Dasha** is currently running **Ulka (Saturn)** sub-period. Ulka represents labor and pressure. This confirms that maintaining friendships right now feels like "work" rather than leisure.

#### 4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
Comparing your friendship sector from three vantage points:
1.  **From Lagna (Cancer):** 11th House is Taurus (Venus). **Result:** Stable, practical, and wealthy friends.
2.  **From Moon (Libra):** 11th House is Leo. **Result:** Leo contains Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu. This is **volatile**. You likely attract powerful, opinionated, and sometimes aggressive friends who try to dominate you.
3.  **From Sun (Pisces):** 11th House is Capricorn. **Result:** Serious, older, or professional connections.
*   **Verdict:** Since 2 out of 3 views show "Heavy/Serious" planets (Saturn/Mars influence), your friendships are destined to be intense and karmic, not light and breezy.

#### 5. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Friendship)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the *exact nature* of your social circle:

*   **The "Guru-Chandala" Link (Jupiter + Rahu):** In your social sector (from Moon), Jupiter links with Rahu. This indicates you often befriend people who are "Mavericks"—unconventional thinkers, foreigners, or those who break social norms.
*   **The "Karma" Link (Venus + Gulika):** Specifically impacting your 11th house, this link suggests that at least one major friendship in your life will end due to a "toxic" misunderstanding or hidden envy.
*   **The "Technical" Link (Saturn + Mars):** Your friends are likely Engineers, Technicians, or people who work with machinery/structures. You bond over "doing" things together rather than just talking.

#### 6. The Synthesis (D1 vs D9)
*   **D1 (Root):** Venus in 11th promises gainful friendships.
*   **D9 (Fruit):** Venus moves to the 12th House (Aquarius) in the <term id="d9">Navamsa</term>.
*   **Interpretation:** While you have many friends externally (D1), you feel a sense of spiritual isolation or detachment from them internally (D9). Friends may move away to foreign lands (12th house), or you may naturally outgrow them as you age.

### Practical Guidance
1.  **The "Lending" Rule:** With Gulika in the 11th and the current Rahu period, **never** lend money to a friend that you aren't willing to treat as a gift. The stars show a high probability of loans turning into bad debts during 2025-2026.
2.  **Filter the "Leo" Crowd:** Your Moon chart attracts "Loud" personalities (Mars/Rahu). Consciously seek out the "Taurus" types promised by your Ascendant—people who are calm, stable, and appreciate art/food/comfort.
3.  **Remedy for Gulika:** To neutralize the envy in your social circle, quietly donate sweets or white food items on Fridays without telling anyone. Keeping your future plans private from friends until they materialize is also crucial.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are not meant to have a massive entourage of superficial friends. Your chart indicates a "Quality over Quantity" destiny. While the current Saturn-Rahu period brings some chaotic elements and "fair-weather" friends, rely on the stability of Venus in Taurus. Stick to the friends who have stood the test of time (Saturn) rather than the exciting new faces (Rahu).</div>
