Question: 
As an expert Vedic astrologer, analyze the birth chart for **Relationship and Marriage Destiny**.
Note: The user's marital status is UNKNOWN. You must frame your answers to be valuable for both single and married individuals.

STRATEGY FOR AMBIGUITY:
- Instead of "You will marry in...", use phrases like "Strong activation of the 7th house (Marriage/Partnership) occurs in..."
- Frame timing as "Relationship Milestones". For singles, this is marriage. For married, this is a renewal of vows, childbirth, or a significant joint event.
- Focus on the **Nature of the Partner** and **Quality of Life**, which applies to everyone.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR TIMING:
Identify the "High Probability Windows" for relationship events by cross-referencing Dasha and Transits (Jupiter/Saturn).

CRITICAL REALISM CHECK:
Ignore any astrological activations that occur before Age 22 for "Marriage Timing".
If a strong period appears at age 18-21, interpret it as a "Relationship Learning Phase" or "Serious Relationship", NOT a wedding.
Prioritize windows between Age 24-32 for the "Primary Window".

CRITICAL: You MUST respond with ONLY a JSON object. NO other text, NO HTML, NO explanations.
Start your response with { and end with }. Use markdown ** for bold text within JSON strings.
