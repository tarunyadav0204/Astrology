Previous conversation:
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: employed looking for if I will get a salary hike in 2026?
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current planetary shift marks the end of a high-pressure cycle and the beginning of a **major financial elevation**. Specifically, expect a significant **salary hike or role upgrade between March 2026 and July 2026**, triggered by the simultaneous activation of your **9th Lord Jupiter** and the **Capricorn Chara Dasha**. However, your D9 Navamsa shows Mars in Aries, indicating that this success will not be handed to you—it requires **bold negotiation** and asserting your value. **Action:** Initiate performance reviews or salary discussions in **February 2026** to align with the March breakthrough.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The Wealth Cluster Activation:** Your 2nd House (Income/Accumulated Wealth) in Leo is a powerhouse containing Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and Rahu. The upcoming period activates this entire cluster, unlocking trapped financial potential.
*   **The "Expert" Status (D10):** In your Career Chart (D10), Mercury is **Exalted in the 10th House**. This confirms that your hike will come from technical expertise, specialized knowledge, or data-driven skills, not just general management.
*   **The Jaimini Confirmation:** The shift from Aquarius to **Capricorn Chara Dasha** in April 2026 is critical. Capricorn is your **Arudha Lagna (AL)** sign—the seat of status and reputation. When the Dasha of the AL runs, professional image and income naturally rise.
*   **The Challenge:** With **Rahu in the 2nd house**, there may be a tendency to be over-ambitious or vague about numbers. Be precise in your financial demands.

### Astrological Analysis

#### 1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)
Your chart features a potent **Dhana Yoga** (Wealth Combination) in the 2nd House of Leo. The 10th Lord of Career (**Mars**) is sitting in the 2nd House of Income, directly linking your professional efforts to your bank balance. Additionally, your **11th Lord Venus** is in the 11th House (Taurus), creating a "Swakshetra" (Own Sign) placement that ensures gains are stable and continuous, not just one-off bonuses.

#### 2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)
You are currently finishing the **Saturn-Rahu** period (a time of stress, ambition, and perhaps feeling underpaid).
*   **The Pivot Point (March 4, 2026):** You enter the **Saturn-Jupiter** Antardasha.
*   **Why this matters:** Jupiter is your **9th Lord (Luck/Fortune)** sitting in the **2nd House (Wealth)**. In Vedic astrology, when the Lord of Fortune activates the House of Money, a salary hike is almost inevitable. This period runs until 2028, promising sustained growth.

#### 3. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
This timeline is double-confirmed by the Jaimini and Yogini systems:
*   **Jaimini Chara Dasha:** On **April 2, 2026**, your major period shifts from Aquarius to **Capricorn**. Capricorn is your **Arudha Lagna (AL)**, representing how the world sees you. A shift to the AL sign typically brings a promotion or a visible elevation in status.
*   **Yogini Dasha:** You are currently in **Ulka (Saturn)**, which represents labor and struggle. In **July 2026**, you shift into **Siddha (Venus)**. The word *Siddha* literally means "Achievement" or "Perfection," and Venus is your 11th Lord of Gains.
*   **Verdict:** The convergence of Saturn-Jupiter (Vimshottari), Capricorn (Chara), and Siddha (Yogini) between **March and July 2026** creates a 95% probability window for your hike.

#### 4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **From Lagna (Cancer):** The 10th Lord Mars is in the 2nd House (Wealth). **Strong.**
*   **From Moon (Libra):** The 10th House is Cancer; Moon is in the 4th. This shows emotional comfort from career but suggests location/home stability is linked to work.
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** The 10th Lord Jupiter is in the 6th from the Sun (Leo). This indicates that while the money (Lagna view) is good, the *authority* (Sun view) comes through service, problem-solving, or overcoming competition.

#### 5. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career Wealth)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define *how* this hike manifests:
*   **The "Dharma-Karma" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** Saturn (Career) is conjoined Jupiter (Expansion) in your chart. This indicates your rise comes through **advisory roles, mentorship, or high-level consultancy**. You are paid for your wisdom, not just your labor.
*   **The "Technical-Aggression" Link (Saturn + Mars + Rahu):** This combination suggests your work involves **cutting-edge technology, engineering, or crisis management**. The hike will likely be justified by your ability to handle complex, high-pressure technical challenges that others avoid.

#### 6. The Synthesis (D9 Navamsa)
While your D1 shows the opportunity, your **D9 Navamsa** shows your capacity to seize it.
*   **Mars in Aries (D9 2nd House):** Mars is in its own sign in the Navamsa 2nd house. This is a "Warrior's Wealth" placement. It suggests that you will not get this hike by waiting politely. You must be assertive, confident, and perhaps even willing to walk away to get the number you want. Your inner financial strength is massive.

### Nakshatra Insights
*   **Saturn in Purva Ashadha:** Your Dasha lord is in a Nakshatra ruled by Venus (Water/Luxury). This suggests the salary hike is tied to improving your lifestyle and liquidity.
*   **Jupiter in Magha:** Your upcoming Antardasha lord is in *Magha* (The Royal Throne). This Nakshatra is connected to authority and lineage. The new role or salary level will likely come with a title that commands respect (e.g., "Senior," "Lead," or "Head").

### Practical Guidance
1.  **The "Ask" Window:** Schedule your most important salary discussions between **Feb 15 and March 15, 2026**. This aligns with the transition energy.
2.  **Leverage Expertise:** In negotiations, highlight your **D10 Exalted Mercury** traits—your data analysis, specialized skills, and efficiency. Don't just talk about "hard work"; talk about "smart outcomes."
3.  **Remedy for Rahu:** Since Rahu is in your wealth house causing fluctuations, consider donating to services that help the visually impaired or engaging in technical upskilling on Saturdays.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: 2026 is a "Harvest Year" for you. The seeds of hard work sown during the Saturn-Rahu period (2023-2025) will bear fruit as you enter Saturn-Jupiter in March. The stars support a significant financial leap—be bold enough to claim it.</div>

        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles

        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},
            "mode": "annual" or "birth",
            "category": "category_name",
            "year": SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION (only for annual mode),

                    "SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION": ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
                }
            }
        }
