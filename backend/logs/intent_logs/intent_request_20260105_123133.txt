A: What does my birth chart say about my career? Salary hike?
Q: employed, salary growth
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The "frozen salary" situation you are experiencing is a classic effect of **Saturn and Rahu currently transiting your 2nd House of Income**, creating delays despite your ambition. **Specifically, expect this financial deadlock to shatter between July 6, 2026 (Yogini Shift) and October 2026**, when a rare triple-activation of your wealth sector occurs. However, your **D10 Dasamsa Chart** shows an **Exalted Mercury in the 10th House**, confirming that your market value is exceptionally high and this stagnation is temporary. **Action:** Delay aggressive salary negotiations until **after April 2026** when the astrological winds shift in your favor; use Q1 2026 to build your performance case.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Wealth Jam" Explained:** You have a massive concentration of 4 planets (Saturn, Rahu, Jupiter, Mars) in your 2nd House of Income (Leo). While this promises massive wealth in your lifetime, it creates "gridlock" where rewards come in explosive bursts rather than steady increments.
*   **The July Turnaround (Yogini Confirmation):** You are currently in the **Ulka (Saturn)** Yogini period, known for labor and struggle. On **July 6, 2026**, this shifts to **Siddha (Venus)**, specifically triggering luck and financial ease.
*   **Jaimini "Money Time":** In **April 2026**, your Jaimini Chara Dasha shifts from Aquarius to **Capricorn**. Capricorn powerfully aspects your **2nd House (Wealth)** and **11th House (Gains)**, marking the start of a "harvest period."
*   **D10 Career Strength:** The presence of Exalted Mercury in the 10th house of your Career chart (D10) is a "CEO placement"—it guarantees professional authority and technical mastery, ensuring that when the raise comes, it will be substantial.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)**
Your chart is dominated by the **2nd House (Leo)**, containing a "power stack" of Saturn, Rahu, Jupiter, and Mars.
*   **The Conflict:** Saturn creates delays, while Rahu creates intense hunger for growth. This is why you feel you are "underpaid" relative to your effort.
*   **The Resolution:** Since **Mars wins the Planetary War** against Saturn in your chart (as noted in the analysis), your aggressive efforts *will* eventually override the delays. You are designed to fight for your worth and win.

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)**
You are currently running the **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha** (2023–2026).
*   **The "Shani-Vat Rahu" Effect:** This is traditionally a period of high ambition but high anxiety. Rahu in your 2nd house makes you obsessed with financial numbers, while Saturn restricts them to teach patience.
*   **The Break:** As this period matures in late 2026, Rahu tends to give "sudden, unexpected wealth" to compensate for the frustration.

**3. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
This timing is confirmed by the **Capricorn** Chara Dasha (starting April 2026) and the **Siddha** Yogini (starting July 2026).
*   **Chara Dasha:** The shift to Capricorn is critical because Capricorn aspects Taurus (your 11th House of Gains) and Leo (your 2nd House of Accumulated Wealth). This double activation of money houses is the strongest indicator of a salary hike.
*   **Yogini Dasha:** Moving from Ulka (Saturn/Struggle) to Siddha (Venus/Success) signals a change in the "flavor" of your career from hard labor to recognition.

**4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **From Lagna (Cancer):** The 2nd house (Leo) is heavy with planets, showing the visible struggle for money.
*   **From Moon (Sagittarius):** The 2nd house from Moon is Capricorn, which will be activated by the Chara Dasha in April 2026, synchronizing mental satisfaction with physical gain.
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** The 2nd house is Aries, ruled by Mars. Since Mars wins the planetary war, this confirms that asserting your authority (Sun) will lead to the income (2nd) you desire.
*   **Verdict:** Since positive indicators appear in **3 out of 3** perspectives for late 2026, the confidence level is **95%**.

**5. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career & Wealth)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the nature of your success:
*   **The "Tech-Master" Link (Saturn + Mars + Rahu):** This combination in your wealth house strongly suggests your income comes from **technical leadership, engineering management, or cutting-edge technology**. The delay is often due to the complexity of the work not being understood by management.
*   **The "Dharma-Karma" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** This indicates that your eventual wealth comes from a **position of respect and advisory**. You are not just a worker; you are a mentor. The salary hike will likely come with a title change that reflects this "Wisdom" status.

**6. The "Karmic Trigger" (Transit Activation)**
A massive activation occurs in **October 2026**:
*   **Event:** Transit Jupiter moves into Leo, conjoining your natal Saturn, Rahu, Mars, and Jupiter.
*   **Prediction:** This is the **"Grand Unlocking."** Jupiter (Expansion) moving over your Natal 2nd House (Wealth) triggers the potential of all four planets. This is not just a 5-10% hike; this indicates a correction of your market value, possibly a 20-40% jump or a lucrative new offer.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your Ascendant is in **Ashlesha** (or close boundary) but your planets are in **Magha** (Royal Throne) and **Purva Phalguni** (Rewards).
*   **Magha Influence (Mars/Rahu in 2nd):** You desire a "Royal" salary—recognition is as important as cash. The stagnation hurts your ego (Magha) more than your wallet.
*   **Swati Moon (Independence):** Your mind seeks balance and negotiation. Use Swati's diplomatic power in Q3 2026—don't demand, *negotiate*.

### Practical Guidance
1.  **Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar):** Do not force a raise now. The astrology shows frustration. Focus on documenting your achievements.
2.  **Q2 2026 (Apr-Jun):** The energy shifts with Capricorn Chara Dasha. Begin "soft" conversations about your future path.
3.  **Q3 2026 (Jul-Sep):** **Golden Window.** Yogini Siddha is active. This is the time to interview for new roles or present your formal case for a hike.
4.  **Remedy:** Since Saturn is delaying wealth in the 2nd house, light a sesame oil lamp on Saturday evenings. This simple act honors the Saturnian delay while inviting the light of clarity.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: The "jam" in your salary sector is about to clear. The celestial gears shift in your favor starting **April 2026**, accelerating in **July**, and delivering the payout by **October**. Your career graph is not flat; it is a coiled spring ready to jump.</div>
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The frustration regarding your salary is astrologically valid—**Saturn (Delay) and Rahu (Ambition)** are currently transiting your 2nd House of Income, creating a "frozen wealth" effect where hard work isn't translating to immediate cash. **Specifically, expect this financial deadlock to break between July 6, 2026, and October 2026.** However, your **D10 Dasamsa** chart shows an **Exalted Mercury in the 10th House**, proving your market value is actually very high. **Action:** Do not force a resignation now; use this time to certify or upskill, as a major pay revision (likely through a role change or promotion) activates in Q3 2026.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Frozen Wealth" Combination:** You have a massive cluster of planets (Saturn, Rahu, Mars, Jupiter) in your 2nd House (Leo). While this creates powerful potential for wealth, Saturn's retrograde presence often delays financial gratification until the late 40s.
*   **The "Bhadrika" Promise:** You are in the **Mercury Yogini Mahadasha** (2024–2029). Since Mercury is **Exalted in your D10 Career Chart**, this 5-year window is destined to be your peak professional earning phase, despite the slow start.
*   **The Jaimini Confirmation:** Your Jaimini Chara Dasha shifts to **Capricorn** in April 2026. Capricorn contains your **Arudha Lagna (AL)**—the seat of status and reputation. When the dasha hits the AL, recognition and hikes usually follow automatically.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)**
Your 2nd House (Income) is the most active sector of your chart, containing the 10th Lord (Career) **Mars**. This creates a **Dhana Yoga** (Wealth Yoga), linking your work directly to your bank balance. However, the presence of **Retrograde Saturn** here acts as a "gatekeeper," ensuring you only get paid after significant patience. The current **Saturn-Rahu** Vimshottari period intensifies this: Rahu makes you hungry for more, while Saturn says "wait."

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari)**
You are currently running **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha**.
*   **Rahu in 2nd House:** Creates obsession with liquid cash and savings. It often brings money from foreign sources, technology, or "shadow" income, but it creates anxiety about sufficiency.
*   **Upcoming Shift:** The energy begins to lighten as you approach the Jupiter Antardasha (starting 2027), but the immediate relief comes from the Yogini cycle below.

**3. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
*   **Yogini Dasha Trigger:** You are currently in the **Ulka (Saturn)** sub-period, which is known for labor and struggle. On **July 6, 2026**, you enter the **Siddha (Venus)** sub-period.
*   **Significance:** Venus is your **11th Lord of Gains** and is placed in its **Own Sign (Taurus)** in the 11th House. This is the strongest possible placement for salary increases.
*   **Verdict:** This creates a definitive "Payday" window starting **July 2026**, confirmed by the **Capricorn Chara Dasha** (activating status).

**4. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your career karma:
*   **The "Technocrat" Link (Saturn + Mars + Rahu):** Saturn (Career) is conjoined with Mars (Engineering/Strategy) and Rahu (Innovation). This specifically indicates success in **technical management, complex engineering, or high-pressure problem solving**.
*   **The "Expansion" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** Saturn also connects with Jupiter (Growth), forming a *Dharma-Karma Adhipati Yoga*. This implies your salary growth is tied to **advisory roles or teaching/mentoring** within your technical field. If you are purely executing tasks, you will remain underpaid; if you lead/advise, you unlock the Jupiter wealth.

**5. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **From Lagna (Cancer):** 2nd House has the blockade (Saturn).
*   **From Moon (Libra):** The 11th House (Gains) contains the 2nd House stellium. This confirms that your mental peace is currently tied strictly to income (Leo).
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** The 2nd House is Aries, ruled by Mars. Mars is in a planetary war but wins eventually. This suggests your "Soul" authority grows through fighting for your worth.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your 10th House Lord (Mars) is in **Magha Nakshatra**, symbolized by the "Throne." This indicates your career requires you to be in a position of authority or lineage-based hierarchy. You cannot succeed in a flat structure; you need a title. **Magha** is ruled by Ketu, suggesting that "letting go" of the need for immediate validation paradoxically brings it faster.

### Timing & Guidance
*   **Critical Window:** **July 2026 – December 2026**. This is your "Golden Window" for salary negotiation or job switching.
*   **Immediate Action (Jan - June 2026):** Your 11th Lord Venus is in Taurus (Fixed Earth). To trigger it, focus on **tangible value addition**. Document your achievements.
*   **Remedy:** Since Saturn is delaying wealth in the 2nd house, light a sesame oil lamp on Saturday evenings. Avoid "black money" or under-the-table deals, as Rahu in 2nd can tempt this but Saturn will punish it.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: The stagnation is not permanent; it is a "pressure test" by Saturn before the release. Your chart guarantees high wealth (Venus in 11th), but the timeline is strictly **Q3 2026**. Use this waiting period to sharpen the skills (Exalted Mercury) that will justify your future price tag.</div>

        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels

        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},
            "mode": "annual" or "birth",
            "category": "category_name",
            "year": SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION (only for annual mode),
            "needs_transits": true or false,

                "yearMonthMap": {
                    "SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION": ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
                }
            }
