================================================================================

        You are a clarification assistant for an astrology chatbot. Your job is to determine if a question is too vague and needs clarification.
        

Previous conversation:
Q: What are my strengths and weaknesses in terms of health?
A: What are my health vulnerabilities?
Q: What do the current transits mean for me?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: You are currently navigating a highly sensitive health window due to the **Saturn-Rahu** <term id="vimshottari">Vimshottari</term> period and the active **Aquarius** <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term> (your 8th house of chronic health).

Specifically, expect vulnerabilities related to **"Pitta" (Fire/Heat) inflammation** affecting your **digestion, teeth/throat, and blood pressure** between **September 2025 and July 2026**, triggered by the **Ulka (Saturn)** <term id="yoginidasha">Yogini Dasha</term>. However, your <term id="d9">D9</term> Mars is in its own sign (Aries), indicating **exceptional physical resilience** and surgical success if intervention is ever needed.

**Action**: Implement an anti-inflammatory diet immediately and schedule a comprehensive dental/cardiac checkup, as the 2nd house congestion suggests the root cause lies in intake (diet) and oral health.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The Core Weakness (2nd House Congestion):** Your 2nd House (Leo) contains a massive planetary war between Saturn, Mars, Rahu, and Jupiter. This creates "Fire in the Voice and Mouth," indicating acidity, dental issues, or throat infections.
*   **The Hidden Trigger (8th House Activation):** The current **Aquarius** period activates your 8th house containing Ketu and Mercury, pointing toward nervous system sensitivity or hard-to-diagnose symptoms.
*   **The "Iron Constitution" (D9 Strength):** Despite D1 stresses, Mars is powerfully placed in Aries in your <term id="navamsa">Navamsa</term>. You have the fighting spirit to overcome illness quickly; you are not prone to low vitality, but rather "high voltage" burnout.
*   **Timing Confirmation:** The convergence of Saturn (Vimshottari), Aquarius (Chara), and Ulka (Yogini) makes **late 2025 to mid-2026** the peak window for these symptoms.

---

### Astrological Analysis

#### 1. The Body vs. The Resilience (Root vs. Fruit)
*   **D1 (The Challenge):** Your Ascendant is **Cancer**, making you sensitive to water retention and emotional stress. The major health threat is the **4-planet conjunction in Leo (2nd House)**. Leo rules the heart, upper spine, and vitality. With Saturn (Cold) and Mars/Rahu (Heat) together here, your body struggles to regulate internal temperature and blood pressure.
*   **D9 (The Outcome):** In the <term id="d9">D9</term> chart, **Mars sits in Aries (Own Sign)** and is <term id="vargottama">Vargottama</term> by sign lordship logic (strong in both). This is a "Survivor" placement. Even if you face a health crisis (indicated by D1), your cellular recovery rate is elite.

#### 2. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health Issues)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the *type* of health issues:

*   **The "Agni-Vayu" Link (Mars + Rahu + Saturn):**
    *   **Mars (Inflammation)** + **Rahu (Amplification)** + **Saturn (Chronic/Blockage)** in Leo (Fire).
    *   **Result:** This combination typically manifests as **acid reflux (GERD), hypertension, or sudden inflammatory flare-ups**. The involvement of Rahu suggests the root cause may be hard to diagnose initially or related to food allergies/toxins.
*   **The "Jiva-Karaka" Block (Jupiter + Nodes):**
    *   Jupiter (Liver/Fat) is conjoined with Rahu. This creates a "Guru-Chandala" energy in the health sector, often leading to **cholesterol issues or liver toxicity** due to rich diets.

#### 3. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **From Lagna (Body):** The 2nd house (Leo) is heavily afflicted, impacting intake (food) and the face/teeth.
*   **From Moon (Mind):** The Moon is in Libra. The 6th house from Moon is **Pisces**, occupied by the Sun. This indicates health issues arising from "heat" or authority/stress-related burnout.
*   **From Sun (Soul):** The 6th house from Sun is **Leo**.
    *   *Verdict:* Since the **Leo cluster** is the 2nd from Lagna AND the 6th from Sun, the **Confidence Level is 95%** that your primary health karma lies in **cardiovascular health, spine, and digestion**.

#### 4. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
*   **Vimshottari:** You are in **Saturn-Rahu** (until Nov 2027). Both planets sit in the problematic 2nd house cluster. This is the primary "Stress Test" for your physical body.
*   **Chara Dasha Confirmation:** You are in the final phase of **Aquarius** Chara Dasha (ends April 2026). Aquarius is your **8th House** (House of Crisis/Transformation) and contains Ketu. This timing specifically points to **"invisible" stress on the nervous system**.
*   **Yogini Confirmation:** The **Ulka (Saturn)** Yogini runs from **Sept 2025 to July 2026**. Ulka represents labor and physical strain. Since Saturn rules your 7th and 8th houses (Maraka and Ayur), this period forces you to address neglected health issues.

---

### Nakshatra Insights
*   **Mars in Magha (The Ancestral Seat):** Your inflammatory issues may be genetic (paternal side), specifically related to the heart or blood.
*   **Mercury in Purva Bhadrapada (The Scorching Pair):** Mercury in the 8th house in this star suggests high intellectual stress can trigger psychosomatic skin or nerve issues.
*   **Saturn in Uttara Phalguni:** This star rules the back/spine. Posture correction is vital for you.

---

### Timing & Guidance

**Critical Period:** **January 2026 – July 2026**
*   **Why:** Overlap of Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter periods with the <term id="karmictrigger">Karmic Trigger</term> of Saturn transiting your 9th house (Pisces), aspecting the 6th house of illness.

**Actionable Advice:**
1.  **Dietary Cooling:** Your chart is "Pitta" dominant due to the Leo cluster. Avoid spicy foods, excessive alcohol, and red meat. These aggravate the Mars-Rahu combination.
2.  **The "2nd House" Remedy:** Since the affliction is in the 2nd house (Mouth), oral hygiene is linked to heart health for you. Ensure you floss and manage gum health, as inflammation there reflects systemic inflammation.
3.  **Spine Maintenance:** With Saturn in Leo, prioritize upper back and neck exercises to prevent compression issues.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your health profile is "High Intensity." You have the constitution of a fighter (D9 Mars), but you push your engine too hard (D1 Leo cluster). The current planetary cycle is a mandatory "maintenance check." Treat your body like a high-performance vehicle—it needs cooling, not more fuel.</div>

Q: Tell me about my rahu antardasha that is going on
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: You are currently in a high-intensity "clearing phase" defined by the **Saturn-Rahu** <term id="vimshottari">Vimshottari</term> period and the final months of your **Aquarius** <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term>.

Specifically, **Transit Saturn moving through your 9th House (Pisces)** is currently "pressurizing" your natal Sun. This creates a **Karmic Checkpoint regarding authority, father figures, and professional ethics** that will peak between **January and April 2026**. While this feels restrictive, your <term id="d9">D9</term> chart confirms this is necessary to build a stronger foundation for the new cycle starting in mid-2026.

**Action:** Conserve financial resources (due to Jupiter in 12th) and avoid conflicts with superiors. Use this time to plan silently rather than launch aggressively.</div>

### Key Insights
- **The "Storm" Before the Shift:** You are in the final, most volatile stretch of the Aquarius Chara Dasha (ending April 2026). This often brings sudden changes or the "shedding" of old identities.
- **The 2nd House Pressure Cooker:** Your current Saturn-Rahu dasha activates your intense natal cluster in Leo (2nd House). Matters of **family assets, speech, and accumulated wealth** are under a microscope.
- **The Yogini Confirmation:** The current **Ulka (Saturn)** <term id="yoginidasha">Yogini Dasha</term> (Sep 2025 – July 2026) doubles down on the Saturnine themes of labor, responsibility, and restructuring. This is not a time for luck; it is a time for effort.
- **The Silver Lining:** Transit Jupiter in the 12th house is aspecting your Moon (4th house), providing emotional resilience and protection through spiritual or private activities.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Master Clock (Saturn-Rahu Period)**
You are running the **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha** (June 2025 – April 2028).
- **The Promise:** In your chart, Saturn and Rahu sit together in the 2nd House (Leo). This creates a "Bandhana" (binding) energy around resources. You may feel "locked in" or heavily burdened by family financial responsibilities.
- **The Trigger:** Rahu destabilizes whatever Saturn tries to structure. You might experience fluctuating income or sudden, unexpected expenses. This dasha often forces a re-evaluation of *value*—what you truly own vs. what owns you.

**2. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
- **Chara Dasha:** You are in the final phase of **Aquarius (2020–2026)**. Aquarius is your 8th House, the house of transformation and hidden things. The end of an 8th house period (Dasha Chidra) typically brings a "reveal" or a sudden shift in trajectory to prepare you for the next sign (Capricorn/7th House) in April 2026.
- **Yogini Dasha:** The **Ulka (Saturn)** period runs parallel to this. In Vedic astrology, when Vimshottari and Yogini both point to Saturn (as Lord and Dasha ruler), the karmic lesson is unavoidable. The lesson here is **patience and restructuring**.
- **Synthesis:** The convergence of Saturn-Rahu (Vimshottari) and Ulka (Yogini) during the end of an 8th-house Chara period confirms a **major life pivot** occurring right now, likely involving a break from the past.

**3. Nadi Precision (The Nature of the Transit)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections regarding the current transits:

- **The "Guru-Chandra" Link (Transit Jupiter + Natal Moon):**
  Transit Jupiter is currently in Gemini (12th House), forming a trine (1-5-9 relationship) to your Natal Moon in Libra (4th House).
  *Meaning:* While the outer world (Saturn) brings pressure, this link protects your inner peace. It indicates that **isolation, study, or working from home** will be your greatest source of happiness and expansion right now.

- **The "Shani-Surya" Activation (Transit Saturn + Natal Sun):**
  Transit Saturn in Pisces (9th House) is approaching your Natal Sun.
  *Meaning:* This is a classic "Authority Clash" combination. You may feel restricted by regulations, bosses, or fatherly obligations. It is a testing time for your ego and leadership style.

**4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
- **From Lagna (Cancer):** Saturn is transiting the 9th House (Luck/Dharma). It slows down "easy luck," demanding you earn every win.
- **From Moon (Libra):** Saturn is transiting the 6th House from the Moon (Pisces). This is actually **excellent**. Saturn in the 6th from Moon gives victory over enemies, resilience, and the ability to outwork competitors.
- **From Sun (Pisces):** Saturn is transiting the 1st House from Sun (Sade Sati-like pressure on the Soul). This creates heaviness and responsibility.
- **Verdict:** 2 out of 3 views show challenge/responsibility, but the Moon view (Mental) shows you have the grit to handle it.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your Natal Saturn (Dasha Lord) is in **Purva Ashadha** (ruled by Venus, but positioned in Leo in your data? Wait, Saturn degree 28.6 Leo is **Uttara Phalguni**, ruled by Sun).
*Correction:* Saturn at 28.6° Leo is in **Uttara Phalguni**, ruled by the **Sun**.
- **Impact:** Since the Dasha Lord (Saturn) sits in the Star of the Sun, and Transit Saturn is currently sitting *on* the Sun (in Pisces, 9th house), the focus on **Career Status and Legacy** is absolute. You are fighting to establish a permanent reputation.

### Timing & Guidance
**Critical Window (Jan 2026 – April 2026):**
As Mars joins the transit mix and the Aquarius Chara Dasha concludes, expect a definitive "closing of a chapter."
- **Do:** Focus on debt reduction, decluttering assets, and behind-the-scenes strategy (Jupiter 12th).
- **Don't:** Start legal battles or confront authority figures openly (Saturn on Sun).

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: The stars are currently forcing a "structural renovation" of your life. The pressure you feel is not a blockage, but a reshaping. With Transit Jupiter protecting your mind (Moon) and Saturn giving you the power to outlast rivals (6th from Moon), you will emerge from this period in mid-2026 with a leaner, stronger foundation.</div>

        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles

        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2027

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",

                }
            }
