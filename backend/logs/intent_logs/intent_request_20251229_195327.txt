        You are a clarification assistant for an astrology chatbot. Your job is to determine if a question is too vague and needs clarification.
        

Previous conversation:
Q: What do the current transits mean for me?
A: What are my strengths and weaknesses?
Q: health
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current period represents a pivotal **"Structural Redesign"** of your life path. With **Saturn** transiting your 9th house (destiny) and crossing your natal Sun, while **Rahu** activates your 8th house (transformation), you are being pushed to fundamentally redefine your values and career direction. Specifically, expect the period between **September 2025 and July 2026** to bring intense but productive pressure, driven by the active **Aquarius** <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term>. However, your <term id="navamsa">Navamsa (D9)</term> reveals a powerful Mars in Aries, indicating that while the outer situation feels restrictive, your inner capacity for action and resilience is at its peak. **Action:** Prioritize clearing debts (karmic and financial) and avoid conflicts with authority figures during this cycle.</div>

### Key Insights
- **The 8th House Activation:** You are currently in the **Aquarius** Chara Dasha (2020-2026), which activates your 8th house. This guarantees a period of deep change, research, or handling unexpected events.
- **The Planetary War Zone:** Your 2nd house (Leo) contains four planets (Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, Rahu). The current Saturn-Rahu <term id="vimshottari">Vimshottari</term> dasha triggers this specific cluster, focusing energy on family resources, speech, and financial accumulation.
- **The Hidden Strength:** While your D1 Saturn is in an enemy sign (Leo), your <term id="d9">D9</term> shows Rahu (current sub-period lord) in **Taurus (Exalted/Friendly)** and Mars in **Aries (Own Sign)**. This confirms that current struggles will resolve into material stability and personal strength.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)**
Your chart is dominated by a massive concentration of energy in Leo (2nd House), creating a "Planetary War" scenario involving Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu. This creates a <term id="dhanyoga">Dhan Yoga</term> (wealth combination) but one that comes through immense struggle and friction due to the <term id="shrapit">Shrapit Yoga</term> (Saturn+Rahu). The current activation of this sector suggests you are fighting for stability and will eventually win, but the battle is currently intense.

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari & Transits)**
You are currently running the **Saturn Mahadasha - Rahu Antardasha** (approx. mid-2025 to 2028).
- **The Dasha:** Saturn and Rahu are conjunct in your birth chart. This activates the "Storm" in your 2nd house. It demands strict discipline with finances and diet.
- **The Transit Trigger:** Currently, **Transit Saturn is in Pisces** (your 9th House), moving directly over your **Natal Sun**. This is a classic "Karmic Trigger" indicating a check on your ego, relationship with father/authority, or a restructuring of your belief systems.

**3. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
This intense timeline is doubly confirmed by the Jaimini system.
- The **Chara Dasha** is running **Aquarius** (containing your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> Mercury). Since Aquarius is the 8th house, this indicates a transformation in career—likely shifting towards research, backend operations, or managing others' resources.
- The **Yogini Dasha** is running **Bhadrika (Mercury)** MD and **Ulka (Saturn)** AD (Sep 2025 - July 2026). The **Ulka** period is ruled by Saturn, perfectly syncing with the Vimshottari Saturn period. This synchronization confirms that late 2025 to mid-2026 is the **peak intensity window** for these changes.

**4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
Comparing the transit of Saturn (the taskmaster) from three reference points:
- **From Lagna (Cancer):** Saturn is in the 9th House. This can delay luck but stabilizes dharma and higher learning.
- **From Moon (Libra):** Saturn is in the 6th House. This is **excellent** (<term id="upachaya">Upachaya</term>). It gives you the power to defeat enemies, clear debts, and outwork your competition.
- **From Sun (Pisces):** Saturn is in the 1st House (conjoining Sun). This creates mental pressure and heaviness regarding your identity and vitality.
- **Verdict:** Since the transit is favorable from the Moon (Mind) but heavy from the Sun (Soul), you will *feel* stressed (Sun) but will actually *perform* effectively and succeed (Moon).

**5. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Karma)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the nature of this transit:
- **The "Saturn + Rahu" Link:** Natal Saturn is conjunct Rahu. This indicates your career success is tied to "foreign" or "shadow" elements—technology, non-traditional paths, or dealing with large-scale unseen networks (like internet/infrastructure).
- **The "Saturn + Mars" Link:** This is the "Technical Master" combination. The current stress is not emotional; it is mechanical/technical. The friction you feel is the friction of "building" something substantial.
- **Trigger Event:** With Transit Rahu entering Aquarius (your 8th House) and crossing your natal Mercury (Career planet), expect a sudden shift in job description or a pivot to a more technical/specialized role around **late 2025**.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your **Moon is in Swati Nakshatra** (ruled by Rahu). This is crucial because you are currently in the Rahu Antardasha. Swati is symbolized by the "Sword" or "Shoot of a plant" bending with the wind. The energy of this period requires flexibility. Like Swati, you must be independent and adaptable. The current Rahu influence suggests that "diplomacy" and "adjustment" (Swati traits) will be your tools for survival during this Saturnian pressure.

### Timing & Guidance
- **Critical Window:** **September 2025 to July 2026**. This is when Saturn (Vimshottari), Saturn (Yogini), and Aquarius (Chara Dasha) all align.
- **Focus Area:** **Resource Consolidation**. Do not expand aggressively. Secure your 2nd house matters (savings, family harmony, health).
- **Remedy:** Since Saturn is transiting your Sun (9th House), offer respect to father figures and maintain strict ethical adherence. The 8th house activation suggests exploring meditation or hidden knowledge can turn anxiety into power.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are in a "Chrysalis Phase." The pressure of the 8th house and Saturn-Rahu is not meant to break you, but to strip away what is unnecessary so your <term id="d9">D9</term> Mars (Warrior) potential can emerge. Trust the process of elimination occurring now; it is clearing the space for the next cycle of stability.</div>

Q: To provide the most accurate guidance on current transits, which area would you like me to focus on: career, health, relationships, finance, or another specific area?
A: What do the current transits mean for me?

        
        Current question: "What are my strengths and weaknesses?"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge
        - D27 (Nakshatramsa): Strengths, weaknesses, general fortune
        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2027

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",

                }
