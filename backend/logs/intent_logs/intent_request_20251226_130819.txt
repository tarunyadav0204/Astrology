Q: Tell me about my husband's health in 2026
A: Based on your birth chart and the derived astrological houses for your husband (Bhavat Bhavam), here is the detailed health roadmap for him in 2026.

<div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: 
The year 2026 indicates a period of **"Diagnostic Sensitivity & Habit Correction"** for your husband. While there is no indication of a crisis, the planetary energy shifts from "low vitality/fatigue" in the first half of the year to "digestive & lifestyle management" in the second half.

**Specifically, keep a close watch between January 15 and May 11, 2026.**
During this Saturn-Ketu window, he may feel physically drained, experience sleep issues, or face hard-to-diagnose aches. However, **Jupiter’s aspect on his derived Ascendant throughout the year** acts as a powerful "Divine Guard," ensuring that any issue that arises is treatable and manageable.

**Action:** Focus on his gut health and sleep routine immediately.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The Husband's Lagna Focus (Aquarius Period):** Your current Chara Dasha is **Aquarius**, which happens to be the sign of your 7th House (Husband). This means the spotlight is entirely on him—his health and career are the central themes of your life right now.
*   **The "Shadow" Influence (Rahu in Derived 6th):** In the derived chart, Rahu sits in his 6th house (Illness sector). This typically indicates issues related to **allergies, gut sensitivity, or anxiety** that are often misdiagnosed as heart or structural issues.
*   **The Protection (Jupiter's Shield):** Jupiter is transiting Gemini (your 11th house), which places it in his derived 5th house. From here, Jupiter casts a protective aspect directly onto his Ascendant (Aquarius). This is the strongest protection available in astrology—it implies good medical advice and recovery.
*   **Strength Check:** His Lagna Lord (Saturn) is in his 8th house (Virgo) in your chart. While this suggests he may have a "sensitive constitution" or chronic concerns, it grants high longevity (Ayush).

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Derived Chart Analysis)**
Using the **Bhavat Bhavam** principle, we rotate your chart to make the 7th House (Aquarius) the Ascendant for your husband.
*   **His Lagna Lord (Saturn):** Is placed in Virgo (his derived 8th house). This indicates that his health relies heavily on **dietary discipline** (Virgo). It also suggests that stress tends to manifest as digestive or nerve-related issues for him.
*   **His 6th House (Illness):** Contains Rahu in Cancer. Cancer rules the stomach and chest. Rahu here suggests sensitivity to certain foods or water retention.

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)**
You are currently in **Saturn Mahadasha**. Since Saturn is your husband's Lagna Lord, his well-being is tied to your Dasha.
*   **Saturn-Ketu Antardasha (Jan 2026 – May 2026):**
    *   Ketu is in Capricorn, which is your husband's **12th House** (Sleep, Feet, Hospitalization).
    *   *Prediction:* This is the most sensitive window. He may feel "burnt out," struggle with insomnia, or deal with foot/ankle pain. It is a period for rest, not high exertion.
*   **Saturn-Venus Antardasha (May 2026 – Dec 2026):**
    *   Venus is the Yoga Karaka (Best Planet) for your husband's chart.
    *   *Prediction:* A significant recovery period. Vitality returns, but be mindful of sugar intake or kidney function (Venus significations), as Venus is in Pisces (his 2nd house of food).

**3. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
This timeline is double-confirmed by the **Aquarius** Chara Dasha (activating his Lagna) and the **Sankata (Rahu)** Yogini Dasha running until March 2026. Rahu creates a "foggy" atmosphere regarding diagnosis, meaning second opinions are necessary if he feels unwell in Q1 2026.

**4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **From Lagna (Body):** The 7th lord Saturn is in the 2nd house, connecting husband's health to your family life and food.
*   **From Moon (Mind):** The 7th from Moon is Pisces. Saturn transiting Pisces (his derived 2nd house) suggests a "Sade Sati" like pressure on his health—mental stress causing physical symptoms.
*   **From Sun (Soul):** The 7th from Sun is Virgo. Natal Saturn is here. This confirms that his health is a "karmic focus" involving long-term management rather than a sudden event.
*   *Verdict:* Since 3 out of 3 perspectives show Saturn/Virgo influence, the focus is clearly on **Digestion and Stress Management**.

**5. Nadi Precision (The Nature of His Health)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi links that define *why* he gets sick:

*   **The "Saturn + Moon" Link (Cold/Water):** Saturn (Husband) is conjunct Moon. In Nadi, this indicates susceptibility to "Cold" diseases—sinus issues, water retention, or chest congestion. He should avoid cold foods in winter/spring.
*   **The "Saturn + Jupiter" Link (Jeevakaraka):** Saturn is also conjunct Jupiter. This is an excellent protection. It indicates that "natural healing," holistic remedies, or a change in diet (Jupiter) will be more effective for him than heavy antibiotics.
*   **The "Rahu in Cancer" Link:** Rahu in the sign of the Moon (Cancer) creates a sensitivity to toxins. He should potentially check for food intolerances (gluten/dairy) in 2026.

### Practical Guidance

**Action Plan for 2026:**
1.  **Q1 Strategy (Jan-March):** Do not ignore fatigue. If he feels tired, he must rest. The Ketu influence in his 12th house requires sleep hygiene.
2.  **Dietary Shift:** With the strong Virgo emphasis (Saturn in Virgo), his health is 80% diet. Introduce warm, cooked foods; reduce raw salads and cold drinks.
3.  **Medical Checkup:** Schedule a routine checkup in **April 2026** (when Venus dasha begins) to clear any doubts from the Ketu period. Focus on blood sugar and cholesterol.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your husband is not facing a danger to his longevity in 2026. He is facing a year where his body demands a slower pace and cleaner fuel. The first half of the year is for rest; the second half is for rejuvenation.</div>

Q: Tell me about my husband's health in 2026
A: Based on your charts and the specific Bhavat Bhavam (derived house) principles for your husband, here is the roadmap for his health in 2026.

<div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: 
The year 2026 indicates a year of **"Habit Restructuring"** for your husband rather than a crisis. The planetary alignment shifts from "hard-to-diagnose fatigue" in the first half of the year to "lifestyle management" in the second half.

**Specifically, keep a close watch between January 15 and May 9, 2026.**
During this **Saturn-Ketu** period, he may experience low immunity, digestion issues, or stress-related fatigue. However, his chart shows strong resilience (D9 Strength).

**Action Plan:** Focus immediately on his **dietary habits and dental/throat health.** The planets indicate the root cause of issues in 2026 will be what he *consumes* (food/drink).
</div>

### Key Insights

*   **The "Foggy" Phase (Jan - May):** The Antardasha of Ketu often brings symptoms that are confusing or hard to diagnose (e.g., allergies, fatigue, gut sensitivity). Do not panic; it is usually temporary and stress-induced.
*   **The Karmic Trigger (Throat/Diet):** Saturn is triggering a cluster of planets in his **2nd House of Eating/Throat** (Pisces). This demands he stop any bad habits (sugar, smoking, poor diet) immediately, or his body will force him to stop.
*   **The Protection (June onwards):** When Jupiter moves into Gemini (his 5th house of recovery), it will cast a protective aspect on his Ascendant (Aquarius), significantly improving his vitality in the second half of the year.

### Astrological Analysis (Bhavat Bhavam)

**1. The Perspective Shift (Bhavat Bhavam)**
To analyze your husband, I rotate your chart to treat your **7th House (Aquarius)** as his Ascendant.
*   **His Body (Lagna):** Aquarius (Ruled by Saturn).
*   **His Health Vulnerability (6th House):** Cancer (Ruled by Moon).
*   **His Vitality/Eating (2nd House):** Pisces (Ruled by Jupiter).

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)**
You are running the **Saturn Mahadasha**. Since Saturn rules your 7th House (Husband), this entire 19-year period (starting 2019) is karmically linked to his development.
*   **Saturn-Ketu (Jan 2026 - May 2026):** Ketu is in his 12th House (Capricorn). This indicates a desire to withdraw, sleep issues, or feeling "drained." Health issues here are often psychosomatic or related to feet/joints.
*   **Saturn-Venus (May 2026 - Onwards):** Venus is in his 2nd House (Pisces). While better, Venus here can bring issues related to sugar, kidneys, or glands if diet is unchecked.

**3. Karmic Trigger & Transits (The "When")**
A **Critical Karmic Trigger** is active throughout 2026. Transit Saturn is moving through Pisces, which is his 2nd House.
*   **The Trigger:** Saturn is conjoining your natal Sun, Mars, and Venus in Pisces.
*   **The Effect:** For him, this affects the **2nd House** (Face, Teeth, Throat, and Food intake).
*   **Prediction:** This is a classic indicator for **dental work, throat infections, or metabolic changes**. The pressure is on *resources* and *intake*.

**4. Nadi Precision (The Nature of the Issue)**
Your chart shows a **Saturn + Mars** link affecting the 7th house axis.
*   **Inflammation:** Mars indicates "Heat" or "Pitta."
*   **Obstruction:** Saturn indicates "Cold" or "Vata."
*   **Synthesis:** He may suffer from digestive conflicts—acid reflux or indigestion caused by irregular eating timings. The Nadi link specifically points to **"Gut-Brain Axis"** sensitivity.

### The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **From Lagna (Leo):** The 7th Lord (Saturn) is in the 2nd house, showing his health impacts family finances or requires expenditure on diet/treatment.
*   **From Moon (Virgo):** The 7th from Moon is Pisces. This house is heavily activated by the Saturn transit, confirming the focus on the **2nd house (Diet/Throat)** is a high-confidence prediction (2 out of 3 charts confirm).
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** The 7th from Sun is Virgo. This contains Natal Saturn. This suggests a chronic, slow-developing need for discipline rather than a sudden accident.

### Practical Guidance

1.  **Dietary Audit:** Since the 2nd House (Pisces) is the focal point, implement a "Clean Eating" regime in 2026. Reduce sugars and cold foods (Saturn dislikes cold).
2.  **Medical Focus:** If he complains of **throat pain, tooth aches, or thyroid-like lethargy**, get it checked immediately. These are the specific body parts triggered by the Saturn transit in Pisces.
3.  **Stress Management:** The Ketu period (Jan-May) affects the mind. Ensure he gets enough sleep, as sleep deprivation will crash his immunity faster than usual during this time.

        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2027

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
