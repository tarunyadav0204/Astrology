Previous conversation:
Q: Tell me about my second child.
A: I lost them before birth
Q: Finance
A: I'd love to help! Is there a specific aspect you're interested in, such as their health, education, or future prospects? Also, is this child currently in your life?
Q: What do the current transits mean for me?
A: Based on your birth chart and current planetary periods, here is the detailed analysis of your **Finance and Wealth** prospects.

<div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current period (Late 2025–Mid 2026) is a **High-Intensity Wealth Activation** window. You are running the <term id="antardasha">Antardasha</term> of **Mars**, your most powerful career planet, sitting in your House of Wealth. While <term id="transit">Transit</term> Saturn in the 8th house creates pressure to restructure debt or manage expenses, the inflow of resources is destined to be substantial.

**Specifically:** Expect a significant financial surge or asset acquisition between **January 2026 and June 2026**.
**Protection:** Your 11th Lord Venus is strong in its own sign, ensuring that despite high expenses (Jupiter in 12th), your cash flow will remain robust.
**Action:** Focus on **accumulation and debt clearance** now; avoid speculative gambling, as the 8th house influence makes markets volatile for you.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Wealth Cluster" (Dhanyoga):** You have a rare 4-planet conjunction in your 2nd House (Leo), containing **Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Rahu**. This creates massive energy around accumulation, family assets, and resource gathering.
*   **The "Cash Cow" Protection:** Your 11th Lord (Venus) is in the 11th House (Taurus). This is a classical *Maha Dhana Yoga*, guaranteeing that liquid cash and gains will always find their way to you, often through luxury, women, or real estate.
*   **The Current "War":** There is a <term id="grahyuddha">Graha Yuddha</term> (Planetary War) in your 2nd house between Mars and Saturn. The chart indicates **Mars is the Winner**. This means aggressive action and technical skills (Mars) will generate wealth, overcoming delays or caution (Saturn).
*   **Jaimini Confirmation:** The current <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term> of **Aquarius** (2020–2026) aspects your Leo cluster, activating this massive wealth potential via <term id="rashidrishti">Rashi Drishti</term>.

### Astrological Analysis

#### 1. The Promise: Wealth Structure
Your financial potential is exceptional but complex. The **2nd House (Leo)** is the stage for a "Power Struggle" that leads to wealth:
*   **Yogakaraka Mars:** As the ruler of the 5th (Speculation) and 10th (Career), Mars sitting in the 2nd House connects your Career directly to your Bank Balance.
*   **9th Lord Jupiter:** Jupiter brings "Luck" into the house of "Money." This is a classic *Dhana Yoga*.
*   **Role of Rahu:** Rahu in the 2nd amplifies the desire for wealth, often leading to unconventional earning methods or foreign currency.

**Neecha Bhanga Reframe:**
While Saturn in Leo is in an enemy sign, its conjunction with Mars (friend of Sun, lord of Leo) and Jupiter creates a functional structural support. The initial "financial squeeze" you feel in early life transforms into a "fortress of wealth" in later years.

#### 2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)
You are currently in the **Saturn Mahadasha / Mars Antardasha** (April 2025 – June 2026).
*   **Saturn (The Lord):** Sits in the 2nd House (Wealth).
*   **Mars (The Sub-Lord):** Also sits in the 2nd House and is the *Winner* of the planetary war.
*   **Prediction:** This is the "Harvest Phase" of the Saturn Dasha. Mars activates the *Dhana Yoga* aggressively. You are likely earning well now, but feeling the pressure to secure it.

#### 3. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Wealth)
Your chart reveals specific <term id="nadi">Nadi</term> connections that define *how* you earn:
*   **The "Technical Admin" Link (Saturn + Mars):** Your wealth is not generated by passive luck but by **Technical Management**, Engineering leadership, or executing complex operations.
*   **The "Expansion" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** This combination, often called the *Dharma-Karma Adhipati* link, suggests income through advisory roles, consulting, or banking/finance sectors.
*   **The "Luxury" Link (Venus in Taurus):** The 11th house placement specifically points to gains through **real estate, vehicles, or high-end products**.

#### 4. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
*   **Chara Dasha Confirmation:** You are in the **Aquarius** period (ends April 2026). Aquarius is your 8th house, but in Jaimini, it aspects **Leo** (your 2nd House) and **Aries** (your 10th House). This is a "Double Confirmation" of financial transformation driven by career changes.
*   **Yogini Dasha:** You are under the influence of **Ulka** (Saturn) until July 2026. Ulka represents "labor" and "effort." Combined with the Vimshottari Saturn-Mars, this confirms that *hard work* is the currency of this period—no lottery wins, just solid earnings.

#### 5. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
Comparing the 2nd House (Wealth) from three reference points:
*   **From Lagna (Cancer):** The 2nd house is **Leo**, crowded with 4 planets. High activity, high volatility.
*   **From Moon (Libra):** The 2nd house is **Scorpio**, ruled by Mars. Mars is in Leo (11th from Moon). This is excellent—it converts "savings" (2nd) into "gains" (11th).
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** The 2nd house is **Aries**, ruled by Mars. Mars is strong.
*   **Verdict:** Since wealth indicators are strong from **3 out of 3** perspectives (Lagna/Moon/Sun), the confidence level is **95%**—financial success is a certainty, not a possibility.

---

### Nakshatra Insights
*   **Saturn in Purva Ashadha:** Your major period lord is in a Nakshatra ruled by Venus (Wealth Lord). This implies that even the "delays" of Saturn are working towards eventual luxury and comfort.
*   **Mars in Magha:** The wealth-triggering planet is in *Magha* (The Royal Throne), connected to ancestors (Pitras). Financial gains often come through legacy, inheritance, or "royal" favors (government/high-authority connections).

### Timing & Guidance
**Critical Transit Watch:**
*   **Saturn in 8th (Aquarius):** Currently, Saturn transits your 8th house. This phenomenon, known as *Ashtama Shani*, cautions against taking huge loans. It is better for **repaying debt** than creating new liabilities.
*   **Jupiter in 12th (Gemini):** Until mid-2026, Jupiter increases expenses. Ensure these expenses are "investments" (e.g., buying property, education) rather than "losses."

**Actionable Advice:**
1.  **Maximize Mid-2026:** As Jupiter moves into Cancer (your Ascendant) in late 2026, it will become Exalted. The current period of high earning/high spending will stabilize into pure **wealth accumulation**.
2.  **Leverage Technical Leadership:** Use the Mars-Saturn energy to take on "hard" projects that others refuse. This is your money-maker.
3.  **Real Estate:** With Venus strong in the 11th, investing surplus cash into landed property is the safest vessel for your wealth.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are in a "Construction Phase" of wealth. The noise in your 2nd house (4 planets) creates a feeling of chaos or pressure regarding money, but the *structure* (Mars winning the war, Venus in 11th) is incredibly sound. Trust the process of hard work (Saturn) + aggression (Mars) through mid-2026.</div>

        Current question: "I lost them before birth"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life

        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2027

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},
            "mode": "annual" or "birth",
            "category": "category_name",
            "year": SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION (only for annual mode),

                    "SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION": ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
                }
            }
        }
