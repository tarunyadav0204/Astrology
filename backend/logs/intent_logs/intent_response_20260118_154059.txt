Question: Jan Predictions:

Event 1: Low Intensity - Preparation
A quiet start to the year focusing on behind-the-scenes preparation and resource management.
Period: 2026-01-01 to 2026-01-31

Possible Scenarios (3):
1. You may experience a period of voluntary or involuntary isolation where you feel compelled to withdraw from social obligations to focus on a hidden project or spiritual practice. This is a time for introspection rather than public launch.
2. Unexpected expenses related to foreign travel or long-distance communication may arise. These aren't necessarily negative but will require you to dip into savings.
3. A minor health issue related to sleep or feet may prompt a check-up, leading to a new wellness routine.

Please explain these predictions in more detail.
