Q: What are my health vulnerabilities?
A: What do the current transits mean for me?
Q: I lost them before birth
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **Saturn-Rahu** period highlights a need to focus on digestion, throat/dental health, and blood circulation. Specifically, expect high sensitivity in the digestive tract and nervous system between **September 2025 and July 2026** due to the active **Aquarius** Chara Dasha phase. However, your <term id="d9">D9</term> chart shows a resilient Jupiter, and Mercury in the 8th house creates a protective **Sarala Yoga**, meaning you have the capacity to bounce back from health scares quickly. Focus on an anti-inflammatory diet immediately to manage the excess heat (Pitta) in your system.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Sandhi" Ascendant Sensitivity:** Your Ascendant is at **29.89° Cancer**, on the very edge of the sign. This is a <term id="gandanta">Gandanta</term> point, indicating your physical vitality fluctuates significantly with stress. You are not "weak," but you are highly "porous" to environmental energies.
*   **The 2nd House "Traffic Jam":** A massive cluster of 4 planets (Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, Rahu) sits in your 2nd House (Leo). In medical astrology, this rules the **face, teeth, throat, and food intake**. This is your primary area of vulnerability.
*   **The Hidden Protection:** Mercury (your 12th and 3rd lord) sits in the 8th house. While this sounds scary, it forms a <term id="vipareetarajayoga">Vipareeta Raja Yoga</term> (specifically Sarala Yoga). This acts as a "shield," protecting longevity and ensuring that chronic issues often find sudden cures.
*   **Jaimini/Yogini Confirmation:** The current **Aquarius** Chara Dasha (containing Ketu) and **Ulka** (Saturn) Yogini vibe confirms that the current timeline requires careful management of "hidden" or hard-to-diagnose symptoms (Ketu).

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Root Cause (D1 Rashi Analysis)**
Your chart features a rare and intense concentration of energy in **Leo (2nd House)**.
*   **The Cluster (Saturn + Mars + Jupiter + Rahu):** This creates a "Planetary War" environment in the house of intake (food/drink).
    *   **Jupiter (6th Lord of Health) in 2nd:** Connects disease directly to diet. Your liver and digestion (Jupiter functions) are under pressure from the dry energy of Saturn and the inflammatory energy of Mars.
    *   **Saturn + Mars:** This combination represents **inflammation vs. blockage**. In Leo, this often manifests as blood pressure fluctuations, dental issues, or acid reflux.
*   **Ketu in the 8th House (Aquarius):** Ketu here rules "phantom symptoms"—pains that come and go or are difficult for doctors to diagnose immediately. It specifically targets the nervous system and circulation in the lower legs.

**2. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **From Lagna (Cancer):** The 6th house is Sagittarius (ruled by Jupiter). Jupiter is afflicted in the 2nd house, pointing to **metabolic and digestive** vulnerabilities.
*   **From Moon (Libra):** The 6th house is Pisces. This points to sensitivity in the lymphatic system and feet.
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** The 6th house is Leo. This reinforces the **heart/spine/stomach** connection seen in the D1 chart.
*   **Verdict:** Since 2 out of 3 perspectives point to Fire Signs (Sagittarius/Leo) and Jupiter, the core issue is **Pitta (Heat/Inflammation)** management.

**3. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health)**
Your chart reveals specific <term id="nadi">Nadi</term> connections that define the *type* of health issues:

*   **The "Saturn + Mars" Link:** In Medical Nadi, this indicates "calcification" or "stones." Watch for kidney stones or gallstones, as well as dental rigidity.
*   **The "Jupiter + Rahu" Link (Guru-Chandala):** Jupiter rules fat and the liver; Rahu represents toxicity. This combination suggests a vulnerability to **toxic buildup** in the liver or allergies to specific foods.
*   **The "Moon + Rahu" Influence:** Moon (Mind/Fluids) is aspected by Rahu. This creates "psychosomatic" triggers—your mental stress instantly manifests as stomach upset or bloating.

**4. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
*   **Vimshottari:** You are in **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha**. Both planets sit in the critical Leo cluster. This creates a period of high physical heat and dietary sensitivity.
*   **Timing Confirmation:** This is double-confirmed by the **Aquarius** <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term> (which contains the 8th Lord Mercury and Ketu) and the **Ulka (Saturn)** <term id="yoginidasha">Yogini Dasha</term>.
    *   **Interpretation:** The convergence of Saturn (Yogini) and Aquarius (Chara Sign) indicates that **2025-2026** is a period for "detoxification." If you ignore symptoms now, they may become chronic.

### Nakshatra Insights
*   **Ascendant in Ashlesha (approaching):** You are at the very end of Cancer. Ashlesha represents the "coiled serpent" and is linked to the nervous system and poisons. You may have high sensitivity to pharmaceuticals—start with lower doses when taking medication.
*   **Saturn in Uttara Phalguni:** This star is ruled by the Sun (Back/Spine). With Saturn here, be mindful of lower back stiffness or sciatica.

### Timing & Guidance
**Critical Period:** **September 2025 to July 2026** (Saturn-Rahu-Saturn period).
*   **Precaution:** Avoid elective surgeries during this window if possible, as healing may be slower due to Ketu's transit interactions.

**Actionable Advice:**
1.  **Dietary Shield:** With the 6th Lord in the 2nd House, **Food is Medicine**. Avoid spicy, acidic, and very hot foods (Pitta pacifying diet).
2.  **Dental Checkup:** The Saturn-Mars conjunction in the 2nd house often attacks the teeth or gums. Schedule a deep cleaning.
3.  **Liver Support:** Given the Jupiter-Rahu connection, consider milk thistle or dandelion tea (consult a doctor first) to support liver detoxification.
4.  **Grounding:** Your "Sandhi" Ascendant needs stability. Regular sleep schedules are more important for you than for most people.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: While the chart shows a "traffic jam" in the sector of health and diet, remember that Mercury in the 8th house acts as a safety net. You are prone to sudden flare-ups (Mars/Rahu), but you also have the luck (Mercury) to find the right cure at the right time. Manage your diet, and the rest will stabilize.</div>

Q: Tell me about my second child.
A: I am deeply sorry to hear about your loss. Please know that in Vedic Astrology, we view such events not as physical failures, but as specific karmic contracts where a soul interacts briefly with a family before moving on. The chart reflects this event with painful clarity, and understanding the "why" can sometimes offer a sense of closure.

Here is the astrological explanation for this specific loss, rooted in the planetary alignments.

<div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: This loss is astrologically indicated by the heavy affliction to your **2nd Child Indicator (Saturn)**. Saturn is currently locked in a **Planetary War** with Mars and eclipsed by Rahu in your chart. This creates a "Pitra Dosha" or karmic block that specifically affects progeny. However, the presence of **Ketu** in the 8th house suggests this was a "Moksha Soul"—a spirit that needed only a brief connection with you to complete its journey, not a full lifetime.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Leo Cluster" Impact:** Your chart has a rare and intense 4-planet conjunction in Leo (Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Rahu). Since <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> is the <term id="putrakaraka">Putrakaraka</term> (Significator of Children), its location in this "war zone" creates high instability for pregnancy.
*   **The 2nd Child Significator:** In your chart, the 2nd child is ruled by the 7th House (Capricorn). Its lord, <term id="saturn">Saturn</term>, is **Combust** (burned by Sun) and in a **Planetary War** with Mars. This points to a "struggle for survival" for the second fetus.
*   **Divisional Chart Confirmation:** In the <term id="d7">D7 Saptamsa</term> (the specific chart for children), Saturn (the lord of the 2nd child) falls into the **8th House** (the house of loss/endings), confirming that the astrological promise for this specific child was brief.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Root Cause (D1 Rashi Chart)**
The primary indicator for the second child is the **7th House** (counting 3 houses from the 5th) and its lord, **Saturn**. 
*   **Saturn's Condition:** Saturn is placed in the 2nd House (Leo) but is under severe pressure. It is conjoined with **Mars** (cutting/surgery), **Rahu** (sudden ends), and **Jupiter** (the child significator). 
*   **The Planetary War:** The JSON data confirms an "Intense War" between **Mars and Saturn**. Astrologically, when the child-lord (Saturn) loses a war to the injury-planet (Mars), it often manifests as a miscarriage or loss before birth.

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)**
This event likely triggered during a period connected to **Mars, Rahu, or Saturn**.
*   You are currently in the **Saturn Mahadasha** (2011–2030). Since Saturn is the specific lord of the 2nd child and is heavily afflicted in the D1 chart, this Mahadasha activates the "loss" potential inherent in the chart.

**3. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
*   **Chara Dasha Confirmation:** You are currently in the **Aquarius Chara Dasha** (2020–2026). Aquarius is your **8th House** (the house of endings and transformations). It contains **Ketu** (the planet of detachment). This timing explicitly activates "Karmic loss" and spiritual detachment, confirming why this event manifested in this window.
*   **Yogini Dasha:** The current Yogini is **Ulka (Saturn)** (Sept 2025–July 2026). In Vedic texts, Ulka is often associated with grief, labor, or "sacrifice." The synchronization of Saturn in Vimshottari and Saturn in Yogini creates a "Double Karmic Trigger" on the 2nd child significations.

**4. Nadi Precision (The Nature of the Event)**
Your chart reveals a specific <term id="nadi">Nadi</term> linkage that explains the nature of this loss:
*   **The "Putra-Dosha" Link (Jupiter + Mars + Rahu):** In Nadi astrology, Jupiter represents the "Jiva" (Life Force/Child). Here, it is choked by **Rahu** (The Dragon's Head) and attacked by **Mars** (Force). This combination, called *Guru-Chandala-Mangal Yoga*, often denies the fruition of a pregnancy or indicates surgical intervention.
*   **The "Ketu Effect":** The 7th House from Moon (representing the 2nd child emotionally) is Aries, ruled by Mars. Mars connects to Ketu via trines in Navamsa, indicating a "sudden cut" or a spiritual interception.

**5. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **From Lagna (Cancer):** The 7th Lord (Saturn) is in the 2nd House with Maraka (Killer) planets Mars and Rahu. (Confidence: High)
*   **From Moon (Libra):** The 2nd child is seen from the 7th house (Aries). Its lord Mars is in the "Leo Cluster" of affliction. (Confidence: High)
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** The 7th house is Virgo. Its lord Mercury is in the 8th House (Aquarius) with Ketu. (Confidence: High)
*   **Verdict:** Since **3 out of 3** charts show affliction to the 2nd child factor, the event was astrologically "Fixed Karma" rather than a variable outcome.

### Practical Guidance & Healing

This chart suggests that the soul of this child was a "visitor"—a high-level spirit (indicated by Ketu) that did not require a full physical existence to resolve its karma.

1.  **Remedy for Closure:** On a Tuesday, donate red fruits or copper items to a charity in the name of the unborn child. This pacifies the Mars energy.
2.  **Narayana Bali:** If you feel a lingering heaviness or grief, perform a simple *Narayana Bali* puja or offer prayers to your ancestors, as this combination (Saturn+Rahu) is often linked to ancestral lineage.
3.  **Future Focus:** The presence of Jupiter in the cluster suggests you have strong potential for mentoring, adopting, or helping *other* children, even if biological progeny faces hurdles. Your motherly instincts (Moon in 4th) are strong and can be channeled into caregiving.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: This loss was not a failure of your body or your care; it was a powerful planetary alignment (Mars-Saturn-Rahu) that created a barrier to birth. The charts indicate this soul attained *Moksha* (liberation) quickly. Your path now is to heal the Mars energy and trust that the soul has moved to a higher plane.</div>

        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles

        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2027

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
