Q: Career
A: What do the current transits mean for my health?
Q: What are my strengths and weaknesses?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Based on your birth chart and the current time (December 2025), you are in a high-intensity career phase defined by the **Saturn-Rahu** <term id="vimshottari">Vimshottari</term> period and the **Aquarius** <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term> (which specifically activates your Career Planet, Mercury).

Specifically, you possess exceptional **technical and analytical mastery** (Exalted Mercury in <term id="d10">D10</term>), but you are currently navigating a "pressure cooker" environment characterized by office politics or complex systemic problems. **However**, your inner chart reveals you are not just a worker but a "technical authority"—the friction you feel is the catalyst for stepping into a highly specialized expert role.

**Action**: Focus on **backend systems, data analysis, or technical restructuring** rather than general administration. Use this period to solve the "impossible" problem no one else can handle.</div>

### Key Insights
- **The Hidden Superpower (D10):** While your main chart shows career complexity, your <term id="d10">D10 Dasamsa</term> chart features an **Exalted Mercury in the 10th House**. This is a "Grandmaster" placement for analytics, coding, writing, or specialized trading skills.
- **The "Leo Cluster" Intensity:** Your 2nd house (Leo) holds four major planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu). This creates massive energy for wealth generation but also indicates frequent "Planetary Wars"—meaning conflicts with authority or power struggles in the workplace.
- **The Jaimini Confirmation:** You are in the final months of the **Aquarius** <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term> (ends April 2026). Since Aquarius contains your **Amatyakaraka (Mercury)**, career has been the dominant theme of the last 6 years, culminating now in a critical transition.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)**
Your career foundation is built on a rare and powerful **4-Planet Conjunction** in Leo (the 2nd house of earnings and resources). This combination includes:
- **Mars (Yogakaraka/Power):** Gives drive and technical ambition.
- **Jupiter (Wisdom):** Adds advisory capacity and management skills.
- **Saturn (Discipline):** Adds structure and longevity.
- **Rahu (Innovation):** Adds an unconventional or foreign element.
*Synthesis:* You are designed for high-stakes environments where technical skill meets executive management. However, with the <term id="planetarywar">Planetary War</term> detected in this cluster, you likely oscillate between feeling powerful and feeling blocked by competitors or rigid systems.

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari)**
You are running the **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha**.
- **Saturn (Mahadasha Lord):** Located in Leo, he demands you build authority through hard work and possibly dealing with difficult egos.
- **Rahu (Antardasha Lord):** Located in Leo with Saturn, Rahu creates a <term id="shrapityoga">Shrapit Yoga</term> vibe—meaning "results through stress." This period often brings sudden changes, foreign dealings, or feeling like an outsider in your own team.

**3. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career)**
Your chart reveals specific <term id="nadi">Nadi</term> connections that define the *exact* nature of your work style:

- **The "Karma-Dharma" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** This indicates your success comes from **advisory, consultancy, or teaching roles** where you guide others using your expertise. You are not meant to be a silent subordinate.
- **The "Technical Master" Link (Saturn + Mars):** This specifically points to **engineering, machinery, technical infrastructure, or logic-based systems**. Your career must involve "building" or "fixing" something tangible.
- **The "Unconventional" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** This confirms success in **modern tech, AI, foreign companies**, or roles that break traditional rules.
- **Synthesis:** You are a "Technical Strategist"—someone who understands the machinery (Mars) but also the big-picture philosophy (Jupiter).

**4. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
The intensity of late 2025 is confirmed by the **Aquarius** <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term> and the **Ulka (Saturn)** <term id="yoginidasha">Yogini Dasha</term>.
- **Aquarius (Jaimini):** This sign holds your **Amatyakaraka (Mercury)**. This is a "Double Confirmation" that your soul's focus is currently 100% on professional status. Being the 8th house sign in your chart, it implies this success comes through **transformation, research, or audit-style work**.
- **Ulka (Yogini):** Ruled by Saturn, this period (Sept 2025 - July 2026) demands labor. It forces you to prove your worth, often through a heavy workload that eventually yields high respect.

**5. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
- **From Lagna (Cancer):** The 10th Lord (Mars) is in the 2nd House. Career is directly tied to **wealth accumulation** and family status.
- **From Moon (Libra):** The massive planet cluster falls in the **11th House** (Leo). This is excellent. Mentally, you perceive this career stress as "worth it" because it drives significant financial gains and network expansion.
- **From Sun (Pisces):** The 10th House is Sagittarius, ruled by Jupiter. This adds a layer of **ethics and higher purpose** to your career goals.
- **Verdict:** Since the "Gains" perspective (Moon) is strongest, the current stress will result in financial profit (85% Confidence).

### Strengths & Weaknesses Summary

| **Category** | **Analysis** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Strengths** | **Exalted D10 Mercury:** You have a genius-level ability to analyze data, spot errors, and optimize systems.<br>**Moon in Libra:** You have strong diplomatic skills (Digbala) that help you survive the intense office politics of the Leo cluster.<br>**11th House Venus:** Excellent capacity for generating cash flow and bonuses. |
| **Weaknesses** | **The "Crowded" 2nd House:** You may struggle with "too many voices" or conflicting priorities. Decision paralysis can occur when Mars (Fast) fights Saturn (Slow).<br>**Saturn-Rahu Anxiety:** You may prone to "Imposter Syndrome" or fear of sudden job loss during this specific Dasha phase. |

### Practical Guidance
1.  **Leverage Your Specialist Skill:** Do not try to be a generalist. Your <term id="d10">D10</term> Exalted Mercury demands that you be the "Subject Matter Expert."
2.  **Manage the Friction:** The Mars-Saturn conjunction in Leo can make you abrasive when stressed. Use your Libra Moon (diplomacy) to smooth over conflicts before they explode.
3.  **Remedy for Saturn-Rahu:** To mitigate the stress of this period, engage in service related to the blind or disabled (Saturn rules the suffering, Rahu rules the outcast). This aligns your karma with the Dasha energy.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are in a "chrysalis" phase. The pressure you feel is the breaking down of an old professional identity. By mid-2026, as you transition dashas, you will likely emerge in a role that is more authoritative (Leo) and highly specialized (Exalted Mercury). Trust your technical competence—it is your strongest asset.</div>

        Current question: "What do the current transits mean for my health?"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny

        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2027

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},
            "mode": "annual" or "birth",
            "category": "category_name",
            "year": SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION (only for annual mode),

                    "SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION": ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
                }
            }
        }
