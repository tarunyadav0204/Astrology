A: Analyze from my chart only. I want to understand when will I have kids I have 2 IVF failures in last 6 months why are IVFs failing and when can I conceive in 2026
Q: My question is about progeny. I am not able to have kids, 2 IVFs failed in last 4 months. Please analyze.
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current Yogini Bhramari period (ruled by Mars) and Jupiter's transit in Gemini have created temporary blocks to conception. Specifically, expect a major fertility turnaround between **June 3, 2026, and July 15, 2026**, when Jupiter enters Cancer and directly activates your 5th house. Your D7 Saptamsa chart shows strong potential for success through medical intervention (Mars in 5th), but patience is required until the planetary protection aligns in mid-2026. Focus on cooling remedies and stress reduction until June to prepare your body.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The Root of the Struggle (5th Lord in 6th):** Your 5th Lord <term id="panchamesh">Saturn</term> is placed in the 6th house (Aquarius). In Vedic astrology, the 5th Lord in the 6th house is a classic indicator of "Progeny via Medical Assistance." It connects the house of children to the house of healing/obstacles, explaining why natural conception is difficult and IVF is the correct path, despite recent failures.
• **Why Recent IVFs Failed:** You are currently running the **Bhramari (Mars)** Yogini Dasha. Mars is your 8th Lord (surgery/obstacles) and sits in the 4th house, which is the 12th from the 5th (loss of pregnancy). Additionally, the current transit of Jupiter in Gemini (until mid-2026) creates a "blind spot"—it does not aspect your 5th house, leaving it unprotected.
• **The Jaimini Confirmation:** You are entering the **Sagittarius-Aries** Chara Dasha in March 2026. This is crucial because Aries is aspected by Scorpio, which contains your <term id="putrakaraka">Putrakaraka</term> (Sun)—the specific significator for children in Jaimini astrology. This activation confirms 2026 is a fertile year.

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View
Your Lagna is **Virgo**, and the 5th house of progeny is **Capricorn**, occupied by the **Moon**.
1.  **Saturn's Challenge:** The 5th Lord Saturn is strong in its own sign (Aquarius) but sits in the **6th House**. This indicates that while the *potential* for children is strong (Saturn is dignified), the *path* is through the 6th house significations: medical procedures, delays, and fighting odds. This is a textbook signature for IVF success after initial struggle.
2.  **The Jupiter Factor:** Natal Jupiter (the universal significator of children) is in the 3rd house. Currently, transit Jupiter is in Gemini (your 10th house). From here, it casts no aspect on your 5th house.
3.  **The Shift:** In **June 2026**, Jupiter moves into **Cancer**, its sign of Exaltation. From Cancer, Jupiter casts a direct 7th aspect onto your **5th House (Capricorn)**. This is the "Divine Protection" required for the embryo to hold.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
*   **Putrakaraka (PK):** Your PK is the **Sun**, placed in Scorpio.
*   **Chara Dasha Timing:** You enter the **Aries Antardasha** on March 27, 2026.
*   **The Activation:** According to Jaimini aspect rules, **Scorpio aspects Aries**. This means your PK (Sun) and AK (Jupiter) in Scorpio will aspect the active time-period (Aries) starting in March.
*   **Verdict:** The arrival of the Aries period activates the "Soul Promise" of children via the aspect of the Putrakaraka.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Progeny)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections regarding the nature of this event:
*   **The "Jupiter + Mars" Link:** Your Nadi chart shows a link between Jupiter (Life Force) and Mars. Mars in your D7 (Saptamsa) chart sits in the 5th house. In Nadi, Mars represents "Technology" and "Surgery." This confirms that your child is destined to be born through technical intervention (IVF/Surgery).
*   **The "Saturn + Moon" Link:** Saturn (Karma) connects with Moon (Motherhood) in your chart. This often indicates high emotional anxiety surrounding the process. The Nadi advice is to detach emotionally from the *procedure* to let the *karma* manifest.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
The convergence of timing systems points to **Mid-2026**:
1.  **Vimshottari:** You are in **Jupiter-Mercury** Dasha.
    *   **Pratyantardasha:** The **Jupiter-Mercury-Mars** period runs from **May 23, 2026, to July 09, 2026**.
    *   **Analysis:** Mars is the planet in the 5th house of your D7 (Divisional Chart for Children). His activation is the trigger for the medical procedure to succeed.
2.  **Transits:** On **June 3, 2026**, Jupiter enters Cancer (Exalted). This aligns perfectly with the Pratyantardasha trigger.
3.  **Yogini:** You will still be in **Sankata-Bhramari**. While Bhramari (Mars) caused issues before, once Jupiter moves to aspect the 5th house in June, Mars's energy shifts from "Obstruction" to "Surgical Success" because the protector (Jupiter) is now active.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D7 Saptamsa)
In the **D7 Saptamsa** chart (specifically for children):
*   **Lagna:** Leo.
*   **5th House:** Sagittarius, containing **Mars** and **Moon**.
*   **Analysis:** Mars in the 5th house of D7 is the specific astrological reason for "medical intervention." It indicates "heat" or "cutting" (procedures) in the area of progeny. The presence of the Moon there is excellent—it ensures fertility exists. The failures likely occurred because Mars (Heat) dried up the Moon (Embryo) without Jupiter's cooling aspect. In June 2026, Jupiter's transit provides that cooling balance.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your 5th House Moon is in **Dhanishta** Nakshatra, ruled by Mars.
*   **The Symbol:** The Drum. This implies that the arrival of the child will be a celebrated, rhythmic event after a period of silence.
*   **The Deity:** The Vasus (Energy/Light).
*   **Guidance:** Since the 5th house lord is in a Mars-ruled Nakshatra, and Mars is in your D7 5th house, donating red lentils or supporting surgical/medical charities on Tuesdays can help appease the "heat" affecting the womb.

### Timing & Guidance
**Primary Fertility Window:** **June 3, 2026 – July 15, 2026**
*   **Why:** Jupiter enters Cancer (Exalted) + Mars Pratyantardasha (Activates D7 5th House).
*   **Strategy:** Schedule your next cycle so the transfer/implantation happens *after* June 3rd.

**Secondary Window:** **November 2026**
*   **Why:** Sun (PK) transits Scorpio, re-triggering the Jaimini aspect on the 5th house.

**Actionable Remedies:**
1.  **Cooling the Mars Energy:** Since Mars in D7 causes the "heat" that rejects the embryo, drink water stored in a silver vessel daily.
2.  **Subramanya Prayer:** Mars is the deity Subramanya. Chant "Om Saravanabhavaya Namah" 108 times on Tuesdays to transform the Mars energy from "Obstacle" to "Successful Surgery."
3.  **Avoid:** Do not attempt a transfer when the Moon is in Aquarius (your 6th house), as this triggers the "loss" vibration.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: The failures were due to a lack of planetary protection (Jupiter in 10th) and a difficult Yogini period. The stars align decisively in **June 2026**. Your chart does not deny children; it simply demands a medical path (Saturn in 6th) and specific timing (Jupiter in Cancer). Use this waiting period to prepare your body, knowing the window opens soon.</div>

        
        Current question: "Analyze from my chart only. I want to understand when will I have kids I have 2 IVF failures in last 6 months why are IVFs failing and when can I conceive in 2026"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge
        - D27 (Nakshatramsa): Strengths, weaknesses, general fortune
        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Questions involving 'when', 'growth', or 'timing' → ALWAYS set needs_transits: true
        - Career questions about promotions/hikes → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",

                }
