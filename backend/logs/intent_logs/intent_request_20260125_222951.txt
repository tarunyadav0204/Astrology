        CURRENT DATE CONTEXT:
        - Today's Date: 2026-01-25
        - Current Year: 2026
        - Current Month: January
        
        IMPORTANT: When user asks about "next 3 months", "next 6 months", or relative time periods, calculate from TODAY'S DATE (2026-01-25).

Q: In general
A: Tell me about my studies in next 3 months. Will I do good, I am preparing for 10th Board exams.
Q: In general
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your studies over the next three months will be characterized by a high degree of intellectual expansion and success, though requiring disciplined effort. According to **Jaimini Sutras**, your current **Sagittarius Chara Antardasha** activates your natal <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> (the <term id="darakaraka">Darakaraka</term>), signaling a period of internal growth. Since your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (Moon) is well-placed, your status as a student remains strong. The **Siddha Yogini** dasha (Venus) ensures that despite some pressure, you will experience "Siddha" or fulfillment of your academic goals.</div>

### Key Insights
• **Intellectual Edge**: The <term id="pd">Pratyantardasha</term> of <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> in the 11th house creates a sharp, communicative edge, ideal for networking and scoring well in viva or presentations.
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your chart shows a **Jaimini Raj Yoga (AK+AmK)** involving <term id="mars">Mars</term> and the <term id="moon">Moon</term>. This provides you with the soul-level drive to excel and gain authority in your peer group.
• **Classical Reference**: According to **Phaladeepika**, a strong <term id="hamsa-yoga">Hamsa Yoga</term> (Jupiter in a <term id="kendra">Kendra</term>) makes the native wise, virtuous, and respected—perfect for academic distinction.

### Astrological Analysis
The next three months represent a vital period of academic foundation. Your <term id="lagna">Lagna</term> is <term id="sagittarius">Sagittarius</term>, ruled by a powerful, retrograde <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> in the 4th house of education.

#### The Parashari View
In the D1 chart, your 5th house of intelligence (Aries) is ruled by <term id="mars">Mars</term>, which is placed in the 11th house of gains. The **Ashtakavarga shows 23 points for the 5th house**, indicating that competitive exams or creative projects may require more "sweat equity" than usual. However, your 4th house (basic education) has **30 points**, showing a very strong foundation and support from teachers.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
According to the **Jaimini Sutras**, your <term id="kl">Karkamsa Lagna</term> is <term id="gemini">Gemini</term>. The presence of <term id="ketu">Ketu</term> here, aspected by Jupiter, confirms a **natural affinity for Mathematics, Coding, or Astrology**. Your <term id="al">Arudha Lagna</term> is in <term id="capricorn">Capricorn</term>; with the Moon in the 2nd from it, your public reputation as a "bright student" is well-protected.

#### Nadi Precision
Your chart reveals a significant **Nadi Link** involving **Saturn + Mercury**:
- **The "Commercial Intelligence" Link (<term id="saturn">Saturn</term> + <term id="mercury">Mercury</term>):** This indicates your learning style is practical, business-oriented, and focused on communication. It suggests you will excel in subjects requiring logic and structured data.
- **Jupiter's Retrograde Reach:** Because Jupiter is <term id="retro">retrograde</term>, it also links to your <term id="moon">Moon</term> in <term id="aquarius">Aquarius</term>, giving you a "double-layered" intuition when solving complex problems.

#### Timing Synthesis
This timing is confirmed by your **Sagittarius Chara Antardasha**, which (according to `sign_aspects[8]`) aspects Gemini (ID 2), Virgo (ID 5), and Pisces (ID 11). By aspecting Pisces, the dasha lord activates your natal Jupiter, the lord of your education.
- **Vimshottari**: You are in **Jupiter-Rahu-Mercury**. The <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> <term id="pd">Pratyantardasha</term>, sitting in your **11th house**, brings networking skills and gains through intelligence to this month.
- **Yogini**: You are in the **Siddha (Venus)** period, which brings a "vibe" of success, luxury, and knowledge.
- **Synthesis**: The **Siddha Yogini** lord (Venus) is in your 11th house, perfectly aligning with your Mercury PD for academic gains.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
- **Lagna Chart**: Jupiter in 4th (Strong academic foundation).
- **Chandra Lagna**: 5th house contains <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> and <term id="sun">Sun</term> (Brilliant intellect, though Sun is <term id="debilitated">debilitated</term>).
- **Surya Lagna**: 4th house contains <term id="saturn">Saturn</term> (Disciplined, slow-but-steady learning).
**Verdict**: Since positive academic indicators appear in 2 out of 3 charts, the confidence level for success is **66%**—expect significant progress provided you maintain discipline.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D9 Navamsa)
In the **Navamsa**, your Jupiter is **Exalted** in <term id="cancer">Cancer</term> (House 12). While in a <term id="dusthana">Dusthana</term>, the exaltation provides "internal resilience." According to **Uttara Kalamrita**, a planet weak in D1 (Jupiter is at 1.02° - Mrit Avastha) but strong in D9 shows a "Phoenix-like rise." You might start the semester feeling unprepared, but your inner wisdom will carry you to the finish line.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your birth <term id="nakshatra">Nakshatra</term> is **Purva Bhadrapada**, ruled by Jupiter. This nakshatra is associated with transformation and "fire." 
- **Current Transit**: Saturn is transiting in **Uttara Bhadrapada**, which is your **Vipat Tara** from your birth Moon in Shatabhisha. This creates danger and obstacles. 
- **The Ashtakavarga Filter**: Saturn transits your 4th house (Pisces), which has **30 SAV points**. While the house is strong, Saturn's presence in a Vipat Tara suggests that your "comfort zone" or "study environment" may feel restricted or under pressure.

### Timing & Guidance
**NADI AGE TRIGGER**: Age 15-16 activates **Rohini** nakshatra themes. This is a "growth" trigger, suggesting that this specific year is a turning point where you move from basic learning to specialized interests.

**KARMIC LANDMINE Alert**: Your <term id="rahu">Rahu</term> at 12.2° Sagittarius falls on the **Mrityu Bhaga** (Death Degree) with 0.8° orb. In your 1st house, this creates a karmic wound regarding "focus." You may feel scattered or prone to headaches/distractions. 

**Remedies**:
1. **Strengthen Jupiter**: Since Jupiter is in **Pushkara Navamsa** (Degree of Nourishment), wearing yellow or honoring a teacher will unlock "miraculous" academic help.
2. **Mercury Alignment**: To help the debilitated Sun (lord of 9th), focus on self-reliance. Don't wait for luck; create it through Mercury's logic.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You have the chart of a "Wise Strategist." While the Vipat Tara transit of Saturn suggests three months of hard labor, your Siddha Yogini and Mercury PD guarantee that the "fruit" of this labor will be sweet. Follow the path of logic (<term id="mercury">Mercury</term>) and wisdom (<term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term>).</div>
Q: Tell me about my studies over next 3 months.
A: Just in general how will be my studies.

        
        
        
        🚨🚨🚨 BLOCKING RULE - READ THIS FIRST 🚨🚨🚨
        Before generating ANY clarification question, you MUST:
        1. Read the "KNOWN USER BACKGROUND" section above
        2. Check if the information you want to ask is ALREADY THERE
        3. If it IS there, DO NOT ask for it - skip to asking about the specific aspect instead
        
        Example: User background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon as a Senior Software Development Manager"
        ❌ WRONG: "Are you currently employed or running a business?"
        ✅ CORRECT: "What specific aspect of your career would you like to explore - promotion timing, salary growth, job change, or career direction?"
        
        Current question: "Tell me about my studies in next 3 months. Will I do good, I am preparing for 10th Board exams."
        
        CRITICAL FOLLOW-UP DETECTION:
        1. If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a FULL ANSWER (not a clarification question), and the current user message is:
           - A correction ("that's wrong", "incorrect", "planet position is wrong")
           - A follow-up ("tell me more", "what about...", "and...")
           - A clarification request ("what do you mean", "explain")
           - A short response referring to previous context ("yes", "no", "okay", single words)
           Then: Return status: "READY" immediately WITHOUT asking clarification. This is a continuation of the previous conversation.
        
        2. If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
           - Extract the area from the user's response
           - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
           - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge
        - D27 (Nakshatramsa): Strengths, weaknesses, general fortune
        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. When clarification is needed, craft a natural, conversational question that:
           
           🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS check the KNOWN USER BACKGROUND section first.
           - DO NOT ask for information already present in the user background
           - Example: If background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon", skip asking about employment status
           - Example: If background shows "FAMILY: Married in 2020", skip asking about marital status
           
           Your clarification question should:
           - Focus on narrowing down the SPECIFIC aspect they want to know (timing, prospects, challenges, etc.)
           - Gather NEW factual information NOT in the user background
           - Sound warm, natural, and conversational (not templated)
           - Be tailored to their exact question
           - Help you provide a more accurate astrological analysis
           
           💡 FACT EXTRACTION BONUS:
           The MORE specific facts you can extract in your clarification question, the BETTER our future responses will be.
           - Instead of just asking "What aspect?", try to extract concrete details
           - Examples of valuable facts: specific job titles, company names, years of experience, number of children, ages, education levels, health conditions, locations, dates of major events
           - These facts will be stored and used to personalize ALL future astrological guidance for this user
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Questions involving 'when', 'growth', or 'timing' → ALWAYS set needs_transits: true
        - Career questions about promotions/hikes → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},

            "category": "category_name",

                    "SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION": ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
                }
            }
        }
