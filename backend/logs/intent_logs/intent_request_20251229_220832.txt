================================================================================

        You are a clarification assistant for an astrology chatbot. Your job is to determine if a question is too vague and needs clarification.
        

Previous conversation:
Q: What are my health vulnerabilities?
A: What are my strengths and weaknesses?
Q: What are my strengths and weaknesses in terms of health?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Based on your chart, you are currently navigating a sensitive health period defined by the **Saturn-Rahu** <term id="vimshottari">Vimshottari</term> cycle and the **Aquarius** <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term> (your 8th house of chronic vulnerability).

Specifically, expect vulnerabilities related to **Pitta (Heat/Inflammation)** affecting the **stomach, throat/teeth, and blood pressure** between **September 2025 and July 2026**, triggered by the active **Ulka (Saturn)** Yogini period.

However, your <term id="d9">D9</term> Navamsa Mars is in its own sign (Aries), indicating **exceptional recuperative power**. While you may experience acute flare-ups (fevers/inflammation), your body has a "fighter's constitution" that recovers quickly if you manage your diet strictly.

**Action:** Implement an anti-inflammatory diet immediately to cool the massive planetary cluster in your Leo (fire) sector.</div>

### Key Insights

*   **The Lagna "Sandhi" Challenge:** Your Ascendant is at **29.89° Cancer**, a "Gandanta" point. This acts like a flickering lightbulb—your physical vitality fluctuates. You are highly sensitive to environmental changes and stress, requiring more rest than the average person.
*   **The Leo Cluster (2nd House):** You have a massive conjunction of **Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, and Rahu** all in Leo. This creates a "pressure cooker" in the sign ruling the **heart, spine, and stomach**.
*   **The Jaimini Confirmation:** You are currently in the **Aquarius** <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term> (2020–2026). Since Aquarius is your **8th House** (longevity/chronic issues) and contains Ketu, this double-confirms the current period as the most physically sensitive cycle of the decade.
*   **Strength Factor:** The 6th Lord (Jupiter) is Vargottama? No, but **Mars is strong in D9**. This cancels "weakness" and replaces it with "resilience." You get sick suddenly, but heal largely through willpower.

---

### Astrological Analysis

#### 1. The Promise (Root vs. Fruit)
*   **D1 (The Symptom):** Your Lagna Lord, **Moon**, is in Libra, which is generally balanced. However, the **6th Lord (Jupiter)**—representing disease—is Retrograde in the 2nd House (Leo) and joined by **Mars, Saturn, and Rahu**. This indicates that health issues likely originate from **dietary habits (2nd House)** and manifest as **heat/inflammation (Mars/Leo)** or **toxic accumulation (Rahu)**.
*   **D9 (The Outcome):** In the Navamsa, **Mars (vitality)** shifts to **Aries (Own Sign)**. This is a massive boon. It implies that while the D1 shows complex symptoms, the D9 shows the internal heat to burn off infection. You are a survivor.

#### 2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari & Transits)
You are in the **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha**.
*   **Saturn** rules your 7th and **8th House** (Chronic Health).
*   **Rahu** is situated in the 2nd House (Maraka/Death-inflicting house) within that volatile Leo cluster.
*   **The Trigger:** This combination specifically targets the "mouth to stomach" channel. Rahu in 2nd can cause obscure allergies or issues with teeth/gums that are hard to diagnose.

#### 3. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your vulnerabilities:

*   **The "Guru-Mangal-Rahu" Link (Jupiter + Mars + Rahu):** In Nadi, Jupiter is the *Jiva* (Life Force). It is conjoined with Mars (Injury/Heat) and Rahu (Poison/Foreign bodies). This specific combo indicates a susceptibility to **blood impurities, high blood pressure, or acid reflux**.
*   **The "Shani-Rahu" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** Saturn is the karaka for longevity. Its proximity to Rahu in a fire sign (Leo) often creates **"Vata-Pitta" imbalances**—specifically anxiety manifesting as digestive burning or stiffness in the upper spine/neck.

#### 4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
Comparing the **6th House (Health)** from three vantage points:
*   **From Lagna (Cancer):** 6th House is Sagittarius. Lord Jupiter is heavily afflicted in Leo. (Indicates digestive/liver stress).
*   **From Moon (Libra):** 6th House is Pisces. Contains Sun (Vitality). (Indicates sensitivity to eyes or heart rhythm).
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** 6th House is Leo. Contains the **Four-Planet Cluster**.
*   **Verdict:** Since the **Leo Cluster** is the 6th from the Sun (Body/Soul), this is the "Triple Confirmation." The primary vulnerability is **Cardiovascular or Digestive Heat**.

#### 5. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
The current health sensitivity is not random; it is structurally timed:
*   **Vimshottari:** Saturn-Rahu (Maraka activation).
*   **Chara Dasha:** Running **Aquarius** (8th House sign), which aspects the Leo cluster via Rashi Drishti.
*   **Yogini Dasha:** The **Ulka (Saturn)** period is active from **Sept 2025 to July 2026**. Ulka is associated with labor and physical strain.
*   **Synthesis:** The convergence of Saturn-Rahu (Vimshottari), Aquarius (Chara), and Ulka (Yogini) makes **late 2025 to mid-2026** the critical window for management.

---

### Nakshatra Insights
*   **Moon in Swati (Libra):** Swati rules "Prana" or wind. You are susceptible to gas, bloating, and nervous exhaustion when stressed.
*   **Saturn in Purva Ashadha:** This Nakshatra is related to fluids. Saturn here can cause "drying up" of necessary fluids (synovial fluid in joints) or issues with the bladder.
*   **Sun in Revati:** Revati rules the feet and lymphatic system. With Sun here in the 8th from Moon (roughly), be careful of foot injuries or water retention.

---

### Timing & Guidance

**Critical Window:** **September 2025 – July 2026**
*   **Why:** Yogini **Ulka** (Saturn) aligns with Vimshottari **Saturn-Rahu**.
*   **Event:** High probability of a dental issue, throat infection, or acidity flare-up that requires attention.

**Actionable Advice:**
1.  **Dietary Cooling:** Your 2nd house (food) is on fire (Leo + Mars/Rahu). Avoid spicy foods, alcohol, and excessive caffeine. Alkaline diets are your best astrological remedy.
2.  **Spine/Neck Care:** The Leo cluster affects the upper back. Yoga focusing on the spine is essential to prevent stiffness caused by Saturn.
3.  **Remedy:** Since Saturn and Rahu are the culprits, charitable acts involving feeding the hungry (calming the 2nd house) on Saturdays are effective.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your chart is not "weak," but it is "hot" and "pressurized." Your 29° Ascendant gives you a delicate sensitivity, but your Exalted/Own-Sign D9 Mars gives you the engine of a warrior. Treat your body like a high-performance sports car—it needs premium fuel (diet) and careful maintenance, or it overheats. 2026 is a maintenance year; handle it with discipline, and you will emerge stronger.</div>

Q: What do the current transits mean for me?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: You are currently navigating a highly sensitive health window due to the **Saturn-Rahu** <term id="vimshottari">Vimshottari</term> period and the active **Aquarius** <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term> (your 8th house of chronic health).

Specifically, expect vulnerabilities related to **"Pitta" (Fire/Heat) inflammation** affecting your **digestion, teeth/throat, and blood pressure** between **September 2025 and July 2026**, triggered by the **Ulka (Saturn)** <term id="yoginidasha">Yogini Dasha</term>. However, your <term id="d9">D9</term> Mars is in its own sign (Aries), indicating **exceptional physical resilience** and surgical success if intervention is ever needed.

**Action**: Implement an anti-inflammatory diet immediately and schedule a comprehensive dental/cardiac checkup, as the 2nd house congestion suggests the root cause lies in intake (diet) and oral health.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The Core Weakness (2nd House Congestion):** Your 2nd House (Leo) contains a massive planetary war between Saturn, Mars, Rahu, and Jupiter. This creates "Fire in the Voice and Mouth," indicating acidity, dental issues, or throat infections.
*   **The Hidden Trigger (8th House Activation):** The current **Aquarius** period activates your 8th house containing Ketu and Mercury, pointing toward nervous system sensitivity or hard-to-diagnose symptoms.
*   **The "Iron Constitution" (D9 Strength):** Despite D1 stresses, Mars is powerfully placed in Aries in your <term id="navamsa">Navamsa</term>. You have the fighting spirit to overcome illness quickly; you are not prone to low vitality, but rather "high voltage" burnout.
*   **Timing Confirmation:** The convergence of Saturn (Vimshottari), Aquarius (Chara), and Ulka (Yogini) makes **late 2025 to mid-2026** the peak window for these symptoms.

---

### Astrological Analysis

#### 1. The Body vs. The Resilience (Root vs. Fruit)
*   **D1 (The Challenge):** Your Ascendant is **Cancer**, making you sensitive to water retention and emotional stress. The major health threat is the **4-planet conjunction in Leo (2nd House)**. Leo rules the heart, upper spine, and vitality. With Saturn (Cold) and Mars/Rahu (Heat) together here, your body struggles to regulate internal temperature and blood pressure.
*   **D9 (The Outcome):** In the <term id="d9">D9</term> chart, **Mars sits in Aries (Own Sign)** and is <term id="vargottama">Vargottama</term> by sign lordship logic (strong in both). This is a "Survivor" placement. Even if you face a health crisis (indicated by D1), your cellular recovery rate is elite.

#### 2. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health Issues)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the *type* of health issues:

*   **The "Agni-Vayu" Link (Mars + Rahu + Saturn):**
    *   **Mars (Inflammation)** + **Rahu (Amplification)** + **Saturn (Chronic/Blockage)** in Leo (Fire).
    *   **Result:** This combination typically manifests as **acid reflux (GERD), hypertension, or sudden inflammatory flare-ups**. The involvement of Rahu suggests the root cause may be hard to diagnose initially or related to food allergies/toxins.
*   **The "Jiva-Karaka" Block (Jupiter + Nodes):**
    *   Jupiter (Liver/Fat) is conjoined with Rahu. This creates a "Guru-Chandala" energy in the health sector, often leading to **cholesterol issues or liver toxicity** due to rich diets.

#### 3. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **From Lagna (Body):** The 2nd house (Leo) is heavily afflicted, impacting intake (food) and the face/teeth.
*   **From Moon (Mind):** The Moon is in Libra. The 6th house from Moon is **Pisces**, occupied by the Sun. This indicates health issues arising from "heat" or authority/stress-related burnout.
*   **From Sun (Soul):** The 6th house from Sun is **Leo**.
    *   *Verdict:* Since the **Leo cluster** is the 2nd from Lagna AND the 6th from Sun, the **Confidence Level is 95%** that your primary health karma lies in **cardiovascular health, spine, and digestion**.

#### 4. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
*   **Vimshottari:** You are in **Saturn-Rahu** (until Nov 2027). Both planets sit in the problematic 2nd house cluster. This is the primary "Stress Test" for your physical body.
*   **Chara Dasha Confirmation:** You are in the final phase of **Aquarius** Chara Dasha (ends April 2026). Aquarius is your **8th House** (House of Crisis/Transformation) and contains Ketu. This timing specifically points to **"invisible" stress on the nervous system**.
*   **Yogini Confirmation:** The **Ulka (Saturn)** Yogini runs from **Sept 2025 to July 2026**. Ulka represents labor and physical strain. Since Saturn rules your 7th and 8th houses (Maraka and Ayur), this period forces you to address neglected health issues.

---

### Nakshatra Insights
*   **Mars in Magha (The Ancestral Seat):** Your inflammatory issues may be genetic (paternal side), specifically related to the heart or blood.
*   **Mercury in Purva Bhadrapada (The Scorching Pair):** Mercury in the 8th house in this star suggests high intellectual stress can trigger psychosomatic skin or nerve issues.
*   **Saturn in Uttara Phalguni:** This star rules the back/spine. Posture correction is vital for you.

---

### Timing & Guidance

**Critical Period:** **January 2026 – July 2026**
*   **Why:** Overlap of Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter periods with the <term id="karmictrigger">Karmic Trigger</term> of Saturn transiting your 9th house (Pisces), aspecting the 6th house of illness.

**Actionable Advice:**
1.  **Dietary Cooling:** Your chart is "Pitta" dominant due to the Leo cluster. Avoid spicy foods, excessive alcohol, and red meat. These aggravate the Mars-Rahu combination.
2.  **The "2nd House" Remedy:** Since the affliction is in the 2nd house (Mouth), oral hygiene is linked to heart health for you. Ensure you floss and manage gum health, as inflammation there reflects systemic inflammation.
3.  **Spine Maintenance:** With Saturn in Leo, prioritize upper back and neck exercises to prevent compression issues.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your health profile is "High Intensity." You have the constitution of a fighter (D9 Mars), but you push your engine too hard (D1 Leo cluster). The current planetary cycle is a mandatory "maintenance check." Treat your body like a high-performance vehicle—it needs cooling, not more fuel.</div>

        Current question: "What are my strengths and weaknesses?"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge
        - D27 (Nakshatramsa): Strengths, weaknesses, general fortune
        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2027

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
