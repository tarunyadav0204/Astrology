Q: What are my health vulnerabilities?
A: When is a good time for marriage?
Q: What are my health vulnerabilities?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your health profile is defined by a critical **Gandanta (Karmic Knot)** placement at your Ascendant and a massive planetary cluster in your 2nd House.

You are currently in a high-alert phase for health. Your **Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter** Dasha (active now) triggers the 6th Lord (Disease) and 8th Lord (Chronic Issues) simultaneously. Combined with **Rahu transiting your 8th House** (which has weak Ashtakavarga strength), this creates vulnerabilities in the **throat/face region, digestive fire, and nervous system**.

The presence of the Ascendant in the **Ashlesha-Magha Gandanta** indicates that your physical constitution is sensitive to stress and requires deeper "unwinding" than others.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The Gandanta Factor**: Your Ascendant is at **29.88° Cancer**, placing it in the "Extreme" zone of the Ashlesha-Magha <term id="key">Gandanta</term>. This is a spiritual and physical "knot" where Water meets Fire, often manifesting as unexplainable autoimmune sensitivity or nervous system "short-circuits."
• **The Leo Cluster (Maraka Danger)**: A rare 4-planet conjunction (Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, Rahu) sits in your 2nd House (Leo). Since the 2nd House is a <term id="key">Maraka</term> (Death-inflicting/Critical) house, this area is the "Ground Zero" for your health vulnerabilities.
• **The Jaimini Confirmation**: You are in the **Aquarius Chara Dasha** (2020–2026). Aquarius aspects your Lagna (Cancer), directly activating physical body issues during this window.

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View
Your chart features a high-intensity "Maraka" activation involving the 6th and 8th Lords:
1.  **The 2nd House Congestion**: Leo (the sign of the heart, spine, and vitality) contains **Saturn** (8th Lord of longevity), **Jupiter** (6th Lord of disease), **Mars**, and **Rahu**. This combination creates a "pressure cooker" effect. Vulnerabilities include:
    *   **Throat/Thyroid**: 2nd House rules the throat.
    *   **Dental/Facial**: 2nd House rules the face/teeth.
    *   **Acidity/Ulcers**: Leo rules the upper stomach; Mars + Rahu here creates high heat (Pitta).
2.  **Lagna Lord Status**: The Moon (Lagna Lord) is in the 4th House (Libra). While angular (good), it is aspected by the Saturn/Rahu/Mars cluster from the 2nd house. This means your physical health (Lagna Lord) is constantly under pressure from the toxicity of the 2nd house elements.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive (MANDATORY)
The Jaimini system confirms the timing of these vulnerabilities:
*   **Current Period**: You are in the **Aquarius** Chara Dasha (until April 2026).
*   **Aspect Activation**: From the `sign_aspects` logic, Aquarius (ID 10) aspects **Cancer (ID 3)**, which is your Ascendant. This creates a direct link between the current time period and your physical body.
*   **Relative View**: From the perspective of Aquarius, the massive malefic cluster (Saturn/Mars/Rahu) falls in the **7th House** (Leo). In Jaimini, the 7th house is also a Maraka point. This "Double Maraka" activation (Parashari 2nd + Jaimini 7th) confirms this is a peak period for health maintenance.
*   **Atmakaraka (Soul)**: Saturn is your Atmakaraka. Being involved in the affliction suggests these health challenges are karmically destined to teach endurance and discipline.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the *nature* of these issues:
*   **The "Moon-Ketu" Link**: Your Moon (Mind/Body fluid) is in a trine with Ketu. This creates a **Psychosomatic Link**, meaning your physical symptoms are often triggered by emotional withdrawal or anxiety. It specifically indicates issues with fluids (lymphatic) or "drying up" of energy.
*   **The "Saturn-Mars-Rahu" Link**: This combination in Leo suggests "Fire and Wind" imbalance. In Nadi, this often points to inflammation that arises suddenly (Mars) and is hard to diagnose (Rahu). It can also indicate surgery or dental interventions.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
The timing for health caution is **NOW**:
*   **Vimshottari**: You are in **Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter**.
    *   **Saturn (MD)**: 8th Lord (Chronic).
    *   **Rahu (AD)**: Amplifies the 2nd house ailments.
    *   **Jupiter (PD)**: The **Jupiter Pratyantardasha**, sitting in your **2nd House** (Leo), brings the 6th Lord's (Disease) energy directly into the Maraka zone for this month.
*   **Transits**: **Rahu** is currently transiting your **8th House** (Aquarius).
    *   *Ashtakavarga Check*: The Ashtakavarga shows only **22 points** for your 8th house, indicating **weak resistance** to chronic issues. Rahu here is unsupervised and can cause sudden, hidden complications.
*   **Yogini**: You are in the **Ulka (Saturn)** Antardasha within Bhadrika Mahadasha. Ulka specifically signifies "grief or bodily pain," aligning with the Vimshottari prediction.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **From Lagna (Cancer)**: The affliction is in the 2nd House (Face/Throat).
*   **From Moon (Libra)**: The cluster falls in the **11th House** (Leo). This is actually positive for *recovery*—Planets in the 11th from Moon suggest that with the right treatment, you have the resilience to overcome these issues.
*   **From Sun (Pisces)**: The cluster falls in the **6th House** (Leo). This confirms **digestive inflammation** and enemies (disease) being a primary focus.
*   **Verdict**: 2 out of 3 views show health stress (Lagna/Sun), but the Moon view promises recovery capability. **Confidence: 80% (Serious but manageable).**

#### Special Points (Gandanta & Yogi)
*   **Gandanta Crisis**: Both your **Ascendant (Cancer)** and **Mars (Leo)** are in the Ashlesha-Magha Gandanta zone. This double Gandanta creates a "physical knot."
    *   *Manifestation*: Sudden spikes in temperature, blood pressure, or allergic reactions that confuse doctors. The transition from Water (Ashlesha) to Fire (Magha) suggests a system that overheats easily.
*   **D30 (Trimsamsa) Confirmation**: In the D30 chart of misfortune, the **6th House (Aries)** contains Rahu, Mars, and Ketu. This is an extremely intense combination confirming susceptibility to cuts, surgeries, or acute inflammation.

### Nakshatra Insights
*   **Ascendant in Ashlesha**: Ruled by the Nagas (Serpents). This creates a sensitivity to toxins and pharmaceuticals. You may have strong reactions to medication. The "coiling" energy of Ashlesha affects the nervous system.
*   **Cluster in Magha**: Saturn, Mars, and Rahu are in Magha (The Throne). This nakshatra is genetic/ancestral. Health issues may be hereditary, passed down from the father's side (Sun/Leo).

### Timing & Guidance
**Critical Period**: The current **Saturn-Rahu** period (ending mid-2026) is the peak vulnerability window. The transit of Jupiter into Cancer (your Lagna) in mid-2026 will bring significant relief and healing.

**Actionable Advice**:
1.  **Dietary Cooling**: With the fiery Leo cluster, avoid spicy, acidic, and heat-producing foods (Pitta pacification).
2.  **Throat Care**: The 2nd house affliction targets the throat. Regular thyroid checks and vocal rest are recommended.
3.  **Gandanta Remedy**: The "Knot" needs loosening. Cranio-sacral therapy, acupuncture, or deep tissue work is far more effective for you than standard exercise.
4.  **Rahu Monitor**: With Rahu in the 8th (Weak Ashtakavarga), do not ignore "minor" symptoms related to elimination or circulation. Early detection is key.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your body is a high-sensitivity instrument due to the Gandanta Lagna. While the current 2nd House cluster looks intimidating, the 11th-from-Moon position shows you have the resilience to heal. Treat your nervous system with extreme care until Jupiter enters Cancer in mid-2026.</div>
Q: I already said health
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your health chart indicates a **highly sensitive constitution** primarily due to your Ascendant falling in the critical **Gandanta** zone (Ashlesha-Magha junction).

Current vulnerabilities are concentrated in the **Throat, Face, and Nervous System** (2nd House areas) due to a massive planetary cluster of **Saturn, Mars, Rahu, and Jupiter** in Leo.

The current **Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter** period (until mid-2026) is a **Maraka (critical)** timeframe activating this specific cluster. With Saturn currently transiting your **64th Navamsa (Pisces)**, you are in a cycle requiring strict dietary discipline and stress management to prevent sudden inflammation or chronic fatigue.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The Gandanta Factor**: Your Ascendant is at 29.88° Cancer, the "Karmic Knot" between water and fire. This makes your physical vitality fluctuate with your emotional state.
• **The 2nd House Firestorm**: The conjunction of Saturn (Chronic), Mars (Inflammation), and Rahu (Suddenness) in Leo creates vulnerability in the **throat, thyroid, teeth, and right eye**.
• **The Jaimini Confirmation**: Your current **Aquarius Chara Dasha** activates the 1/7 axis heavily, confirming stress on the physical body (1st from Dasha sign).

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View
Your chart features a rare and intense **Four-Planet Conjunction** in the 2nd House (Leo):
1.  **6th Lord (Jupiter):** Represents disease/digestion, sitting with malefics.
2.  **8th Lord (Saturn):** Represents chronic illness, sitting in the Maraka (2nd) house.
3.  **Mars & Rahu:** Add heat and unpredictability.
This combination suggests that your health issues may start with **inflammation or heat** (Mars/Pitta) but can become **chronic or hard to diagnose** (Saturn/Rahu). Since this happens in Leo, the **cardiovascular system** and **upper respiratory tract** are sensitive.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive (MANDATORY)
From the perspective of your current **Aquarius** Chara Dasha:
*   **The 1st House (Aquarius):** Contains Mercury and Ketu. Ketu in the body's sign often indicates "phantom pains" or diagnostic confusion.
*   **The 7th House (Leo):** Contains the massive 4-planet cluster. In Jaimini, afflictions to the 1/7 axis from the Dasha sign directly impact the physical vessel (Deha).
*   **Double Confirmation:** The **Atmakaraka (Saturn)** and **Gnatikaraka (Venus)** are in 6/8 relationship, indicating that health challenges (GK) serve as a catalyst for soul growth (AK).

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the nature of ailments:
*   **The "Saturn + Rahu" Link:** Indicates health issues that may be **obscure, related to toxins, or hard to diagnose**. It often points to allergies or autoimmune sensitivities.
*   **The "Saturn + Mars" Link:** A classic signature for **surgery or sudden injury**. Since this occurs in a Fire sign (Leo), it specifically warns against acidity, blood pressure spikes, and inflammation.
*   **The "Moon + Ketu" Link:** Mentally, this creates "detachment or anxiety" which directly impacts your gut health (Moon rules 4th house/stomach region).

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
This period is critical due to the convergence of three timing systems:
1.  **Vimshottari:** You are in **Saturn MD / Rahu AD**. Both planets sit in your 2nd House (Maraka/Health Crisis).
2.  **Pratyantardasha:** The **Jupiter Pratyantardasha**, sitting in your 2nd house (Leo), triggers this combination *right now*. Jupiter rules your 6th house of acute illness.
3.  **Yogini:** The current **Ulka (Saturn)** Yogini confirms the Vimshottari Lord. Ulka specifically brings "physical strain and labor."
4.  **Chara Dasha:** The **Aquarius** period activates the Ketu-Mercury axis, suggesting nerve-related sensitivities.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **From Lagna (Body):** The 2nd house (Leo) is heavily afflicted, showing the physical symptoms described above.
*   **From Moon (Mind):** The 2nd house from Moon (Scorpio) is aspected by the Leo cluster (Mars/Saturn/Rahu), showing that mental stress exacerbates physical symptoms.
*   **From Sun (Soul):** The 6th house from Sun (Leo) contains the *exact same cluster*.
**Verdict:** Since this affliction appears in **3 out of 3 charts**, the confidence level is **95%** - these vulnerabilities are structural, not just passing transits.

#### Special Points (Gandanta & Yogi)
*   **Gandanta Analysis:** Your Ascendant (29.88° Cancer) and Mars (2.39° Leo) are both in the **Ashlesha-Magha Gandanta**. This is the "Zone of Transformation." Medical interventions here often require a holistic approach (treating the whole system) rather than just symptoms.
*   **64th Navamsa Trigger:** Saturn is currently transiting **Pisces**, which is your **64th Navamsa**. This is a classic astrological checkpoint for physical vulnerability.

### Nakshatra Insights
*   **Ascendant in Ashlesha (Gandanta):** ruled by Mercury/Serpents. This indicates a nervous system that is highly "wired." You may feel energy shifts or toxins more acutely than others.
*   **Saturn/Mars in Magha/Uttara Phalguni:** Focuses the karmic lessons on the **heart and spine**. You must maintain a straight posture and keep the heart chakra open (emotionally and physically).

### Timing & Guidance
*   **Current Transit Alert (Saturn in Pisces):** Saturn transits your 9th house but is the **64th Navamsa Lord**.
    *   *Ashtakavarga Check:* Your 9th house has **29 points (Strong)**, suggesting that while health challenges arise, you have the grace/luck to find the right doctors or remedies.
*   **Rahu Transit (Aquarius):** Rahu is transiting your 8th house.
    *   *Ashtakavarga Check:* Your 8th house has only **22 points (Weak)**. This is a red flag. Do not ignore minor symptoms during this transit (2026). The body's natural defense in the 8th house sector is currently low.

**Actionable Advice:**
1.  **Diet:** The 2nd house affliction requires a strict "cooling" diet. Avoid spicy, acidic, or overly hot foods to pacify the Mars/Rahu influence in Leo.
2.  **Throat Care:** Regular gargling, thyroid checks, and vocal rest are recommended.
3.  **Remedy:** Since Saturn and Rahu are the primary triggers, selfless service (Seva) on Saturdays is the best remedy.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are in a period of "Physical recalibration." The Gandanta Ascendant means your body is a sensitive instrument. Treat it with extreme care during this Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter cycle, and prioritize calming the nervous system.</div>

        Current question: "When is a good time for marriage?"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response

        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]

        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. When clarification is needed, craft a natural, conversational question that:
           
           🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS check the KNOWN USER BACKGROUND section first.
           - DO NOT ask for information already present in the user background
           - Example: If background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon", skip asking about employment status
           - Example: If background shows "FAMILY: Married in 2020", skip asking about marital status
           
           Your clarification question should:
           - Focus on narrowing down the SPECIFIC aspect they want to know (timing, prospects, challenges, etc.)
           - Gather NEW factual information NOT in the user background
           - Sound warm, natural, and conversational (not templated)
           - Be tailored to their exact question
           - Help you provide a more accurate astrological analysis
           
           💡 FACT EXTRACTION BONUS:
           The MORE specific facts you can extract in your clarification question, the BETTER our future responses will be.
           - Instead of just asking "What aspect?", try to extract concrete details
           - Examples of valuable facts: specific job titles, company names, years of experience, number of children, ages, education levels, health conditions, locations, dates of major events
           - These facts will be stored and used to personalize ALL future astrological guidance for this user
        
        4. Max 3 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Questions involving 'when', 'growth', or 'timing' → ALWAYS set needs_transits: true
        - Career questions about promotions/hikes → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028
