        You are a clarification assistant for an astrology chatbot. Your job is to determine if a question is too vague and needs clarification.
        

Previous conversation:
Q: Tell me about my current dasha period in terms of health
A: What does my birth chart say about my career?
Q: What are my strengths and weaknesses about helath?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **Saturn-Rahu** period (active until late 2026) concentrates intense planetary energy in your 2nd House (Leo), creating a specific sensitivity in the **throat, teeth, and dietary system**. **Specifically, be vigilant about inflammation, dental issues, or food sensitivities between April 2026 and July 2026**, as the shift into the **Capricorn Chara Dasha** (activating the Maraka 7th house) coincides with Mars transiting your natal Moon. **However, your D9 Navamsa shows Jupiter in a Kendra (4th House), providing strong recovery power through medical wisdom and dietary discipline**. **Action:** Schedule a preventative dental check-up and adopt an anti-inflammatory diet immediately to mitigate the Mars-Rahu heat.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Cluster" Challenge:** Your 2nd House (Leo) contains a massive conjunction of **Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu**. In health astrology, the 2nd house governs the **face, mouth, teeth, and food intake**, while Leo governs the **heart and upper stomach**. The presence of fiery Mars and airy Rahu here suggests "heat" issues like acidity, inflammation, or dental pain.
*   **The 8th House Transit Warning:** Currently, transit Rahu is moving through your **8th House (Aquarius)**. The 8th house rules elimination and hidden ailments. This confirms a need to detoxify, as the body may struggle to process heavy foods or toxins during this cycle.
*   **The Jaimini Confirmation:** The Chara Dasha is shifting from **Aquarius (8th House sign)** to **Capricorn (7th House sign)** in **April 2026**. Moving from a "Dusthana" (8th) to a "Maraka" (7th) sign signals a peak period of physical vulnerability where latent issues often surface to be healed.
*   **D9 Strength:** While the D1 chart shows stress, your D9 Navamsa has Mars in its own sign (Aries) and Jupiter in a quadrant. This is the mark of a "fighter"—someone who recovers quickly once the correct diagnosis is found.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha): Saturn-Rahu Period**
You are currently running the **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha**.
*   **Saturn (The Lord of Longevity):** Saturn rules your 7th and 8th houses (Maraka and Longevity) and sits in the 2nd house. This connects "longevity" directly with "eating habits" and the "mouth."
*   **Rahu (The Amplifier):** Rahu sits with Saturn in Leo. Rahu in Leo tends to create palpitations, anxiety, or heat-related issues (pitta). In the 2nd house, it specifically points to **dental trouble** or **throat infections**.
*   **The Conflict:** Saturn is cold/constricting while Mars/Rahu are hot/explosive. This "Fire and Ice" combination in the body often manifests as alternating issues—e.g., suppression (Saturn) followed by acute inflammation (Mars).

**2. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
*   **Chara Dasha Trigger:** You are concluding the **Aquarius** period (activating your 8th house of chronic health) and entering **Capricorn** (activating your 7th house). The *Gnatikaraka* (health planet) in your chart is **Venus**. Since Capricorn is the 6th from Venus (in D9 context), this transition confirms health matters will take center stage in **mid-2026**.
*   **Yogini Confirmation:** You are currently under **Ulka (Saturn)** Yogini. Ulka is associated with labor, exhaustion, and head/heart pressure. This perfectly matches the Saturn-Rahu Vimshottari period, doubling the indication of stress-induced physical strain.

**3. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
To validate the severity, we check the **6th House of Disease** from three reference points:
*   **From Lagna (Cancer):** The 6th house is Sagittarius (ruled by Jupiter). Jupiter is afflicted in the 2nd house cluster. This links digestion (Jupiter) to the disease sector.
*   **From Moon (Libra):** The 6th house is Pisces (ruled by Jupiter). Again, Jupiter is the key. The Sun is in this 6th house, indicating strong vitality but potential "burnout" or fevers.
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** The 6th house is **Leo**. **CRITICAL FINDING:** Your massive 4-planet cluster (Saturn, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter) sits in the **6th house from your Sun**. This is the strongest indicator that your health challenges are karmic in nature and require serious lifestyle management, specifically related to the Leo (Heart/Spine) and 2nd House (Mouth/Throat) areas.
*   **Verdict:** Since the affliction appears most severely from the **Sun Lagna** (Soul/Vitality), the confidence level is **High (85%)** that health maintenance is your primary karma right now.

**4. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your health patterns:
*   **The "Agni-Vayu" Link (Mars + Rahu):** Mars (Fire) and Rahu (Air) are conjoined. Physically, this creates "fanning the flames." It typically indicates **hyper-acidity, sudden fevers, or allergic reactions** to specific foods.
*   **The "Shani-Mangal" Link (Saturn + Mars):** This yoga often relates to **bones and muscles**. Specifically, with the Leo influence, it can indicate stiffness in the upper back or neck, and dental brittleness (Saturn rules teeth, Mars rules the nerve/pain).

### Nakshatra Insights
*   **Saturn in Purva Ashadha:** This Nakshatra is ruled by Venus (water) and associated with "invincibility" but also kidneys/fluids. Ensure you are hydrating properly, as Saturn here can cause dehydration or stones.
*   **Rahu in Magha:** Magha is ruled by Ketu and connected to ancestors/genetic lineage. Health issues in this period may be **hereditary**. Look at your paternal family history for heart or blood-related patterns.

### Timing & Guidance
**Critical Windows:**
*   **April 2026 - July 2026:** High Alert. Mars transits will trigger the natal Rahu/Mars axis. Avoid elective surgeries during this window if possible.
*   **Late 2026:** Relief begins as Jupiter moves towards its exaltation sign (Cancer), aspecting your Lagna and boosting immunity.

**Actionable Advice:**
1.  **Dietary Cooling:** With Mars-Rahu in the 2nd house, your body is running "hot." Eliminate spicy foods, excessive caffeine, and alcohol immediately. Introduce cooling foods (alkaline diet).
2.  **Dental Defense:** Do not wait for tooth pain. The planetary combination strongly suggests dental procedures. A check-up now can prevent a root canal in 2026.
3.  **Throat Chakra Work:** The 2nd house rules the voice. If you suppress your speech or anger, it will manifest as throat inflammation. Singing, chanting, or honest communication is a remedy.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: While the chart shows a "busy" and potentially stressful 2nd house affecting health, your D9 Jupiter provides the wisdom to manage it. This is not a period of unmanageable disease, but rather a loud "wake-up call" from your body demanding a cleaner diet and stress management. Treat your body like a temple, especially your digestion and teeth, and you will navigate this period successfully.</div>
Q: What are my strengths and weaknesses in health?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **Saturn-Rahu** period (active through 2026) concentrates intense energy in your 2nd House (Leo), creating sensitivity in the throat, teeth, and cardiovascular system. **Specifically, be vigilant about inflammation in the throat or dental issues between March 2026 and May 2026**, as you transition into the **Capricorn Chara Dasha** (activating the Maraka 7th house) which can trigger a sudden release of physical stress. **However, your D9 Navamsa shows a strong Mars in Aries**, confirming your body has exceptional recovery speed and immunity post-treatment. **Action:** Schedule a preventative dental checkup and adopt an anti-inflammatory diet immediately to mitigate the Rahu-Mars heat.</div>

### Key Insights

*   **The "Leo Cluster" Vulnerability:** Your 2nd House (Leo) contains a massive planetary war between Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu. This creates a specific weakness in the **throat, right eye, teeth, and heart region**. Stress goes straight to your upper spine and jaw.
*   **The "Crisis Manager" Strength:** Mercury is in your 8th House (Aquarius) creating a <term id="viparita_raja_yoga">Viparita Raja Yoga</term>. This is a "Teflon" placement—while you may face sudden health scares, you rarely face hospitalization. You have a knack for misdiagnosis followed by a sudden, correct self-diagnosis or alternative cure.
*   **Gandanta Sensitivity:** Your Ascendant is at 29.89° Cancer (the very edge of the sign). This <term id="gandanta">Gandanta</term> point means your physical vitality is highly sensitive to environmental changes, weather, and water-borne issues.
*   **The Jaimini Confirmation:** You are currently ending the **Aquarius Chara Dasha** (containing Ketu/Mercury in the 8th) and entering **Capricorn** (April 2026). This shift from an "8th house transformation" period to a "7th house Maraka" period confirms 2026 is a year to prioritize bodily maintenance over endurance.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)**
Your chart presents a "High Voltage" health profile. The 6th Lord (Disease) is **Jupiter**, situated in the 2nd House (Leo) with **Saturn, Mars, and Rahu**.
*   **The Weakness:** The 2nd house rules oral health and food intake. With **Rahu (toxins)** and **Mars (inflammation)** here, you are prone to issues arising from diet, acidity, or dental infections.
*   **The Strength:** The dispositor of this cluster is the **Sun**, which is placed in the **9th House (Pisces)**. This is excellent. It means that despite the scary lineup in Leo, the "Lord of Vitality" (Sun) is protected in a house of grace (9th). Recovery is always favored by "luck" or good doctors.

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari)**
You are in **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha**.
*   **Saturn** rules your 8th house (longevity/chronic issues) and sits in the 2nd.
*   **Rahu** sits in the 2nd.
*   *Result:* This double activation of the 2nd house is the primary cause of current sensitivities. It often manifests as "drying" issues—dry cough, dental decay, or stiffness in the neck/shoulders.

**3. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
This timing is confirmed by the **Aquarius** Chara Dasha (containing 8th House occupants) and the **Ulka (Saturn)** Yogini.
*   **Chara Dasha:** Aquarius rules your 8th house of "sudden changes." Its end in April 2026 marks the climax of this energy.
*   **Yogini Dasha:** You are under **Ulka** (ruled by Saturn). In Medical Astrology, Ulka represents "The Fall" or physical exhaustion. The overlap of Saturn in Vimshottari and Saturn in Yogini makes this the *most* important health year of the decade.

**4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **From Lagna (Body):** 6th House is Sagittarius (Hips/Liver). Lord Jupiter is afflicted.
*   **From Moon (Mind):** 6th House from Libra is Pisces. Sun is there. This suggests your *mind* perceives health as robust and sunny, potentially causing you to ignore early symptoms.
*   **From Sun (Soul):** 6th House from Pisces is **Leo**. Here lies the problem. The "Soul" chart confirms the **Leo Cluster** is the root cause. The convergence of 2 out of 3 charts on the Fire Signs (Leo/Sagittarius) indicates inflammation (Pitta) is your primary enemy.

**5. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your health patterns:
*   **The "Inflammation" Link (Mars + Rahu):** Mars (Heat) and Rahu (Amplifier) are conjoined. This creates sudden, acute flare-ups rather than slow diseases. Think high fevers, sudden toothaches, or allergic reactions.
*   **The "Vata" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** Saturn (Wind/Dryness) with Rahu creates anxiety-induced physical symptoms, specifically palpitations or tremors when under stress.
*   **The "Dharma" Link (Jupiter + Ketu via trine):** This connection (Jupiter in Leo, Ketu in Sagittarius D9) suggests that traditional Ayurvedic or holistic remedies work better for you than harsh chemical antibiotics, which might trigger your Rahu sensitivity.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your **Ascendant is in Ashlesha** (though technically Gandanta, moving to Magha). However, your **Moon is in Swati** (ruled by Rahu).
*   <term id="swati_nakshatra">Swati</term> rules the "breath" (Prana). With your Moon here, deep breathing exercises (Pranayama) are not just spiritual for you—they are medical necessities to regulate the Vata imbalance caused by Saturn-Rahu.
*   **Saturn in Purva Ashadha:** This Nakshatra is associated with "invincibility" but also water retention. Ensure your kidneys are flushed regularly (drink water) to appease Venus (ruler of Purva Ashadha).

### Timing & Guidance
**Critical Window:** **March 15, 2026 – May 20, 2026**.
*   *Why:* Mars transits your 7th/8th house axis while Chara Dasha shifts.
*   *Precaution:* Avoid elective surgeries during this specific window if possible.

**Actionable Advice:**
1.  **Dental Defense:** The 2nd house affliction is classic for root canals or gum issues. Floss daily and get a cleaning now, before the April transit.
2.  **Cooling Diet:** Your chart is "Overheated" (Pitta). Reduce spicy foods, red meat, and alcohol immediately. Introduce cooling foods like cucumber, mint, and coconut water.
3.  **Throat Protection:** You are prone to thyroid fluctuations or vocal strain. If you speak for a living, rest your voice.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your health "weakness" is essentially a traffic jam of energy in Leo (Heart/Throat). Your "strength" is a powerful 8th House Mercury that allows you to hack your own biology. You are not frail; you are just high-maintenance. Treat your body like a high-performance sports car—it needs premium fuel and regular tuning, or the engine (Leo) overheats.</div>

        
        Current question: "What does my birth chart say about my career?"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge

        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
