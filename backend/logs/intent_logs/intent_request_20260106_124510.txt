Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?I am employed and want to ask about salary growth
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter** period (active now through early 2026) creates a massive "Wealth Convergence" in your chart. Specifically, expect significant salary discussions or a financial jump between **January and April 2026**, as your Arudha Lagna (Status) is activated by the Jaimini Chara Dasha. However, your D9 Navamsa shows Saturn in the 10th house, indicating this growth comes with increased responsibility or a heavier workload. **Action:** Leverage your technical or specialized skills now; the planets in your 2nd House of Salary support an immediate ask.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The Salary Trigger (2nd House Cluster):** You have a rare triple conjunction of **Saturn, Rahu, and Jupiter** all sitting in your 2nd House (Leo). This is the specific house of "accumulated wealth" and "salary." The fact that your current Dasha lords (Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter) are *all* in this house makes this the most significant financial window of the decade.
*   **The Jaimini Secret:** Your current Chara Antardasha is **Capricorn**, which holds your **Arudha Lagna (AL)**. In Jaimini astrology, when the AL is active, your public status and professional price tag rise.
*   **Career Authority (D10 Chart):** Your D10 Dasamsa chart features an **Exalted Mercury** in the 10th House. This confirms that your career foundation is rock-solid and capable of sustaining high executive roles.
*   **The Challenge:** The **Ulka (Saturn)** Yogini Dasha suggests this raise won't be "easy money"—it requires you to take on a stressful or high-pressure project (Saturn/Rahu nature).

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View
Your chart is currently dominated by the 2nd House of Income (Leo).
*   **The Master Clock (Vimshottari):** You are in the **Saturn Mahadasha**, **Rahu Antardasha**, and **Jupiter Pratyantardasha**.
*   **The Alignment:** All three of these planets sit in your 2nd House (Salary).
    *   **Saturn** (Career Lord) brings the structure for wealth.
    *   **Rahu** (Amplifier) brings the desire for a "jump" rather than a small increment.
    *   **Jupiter** (Wealth Karaka) rules your 6th house (daily job) and 9th house (luck), connecting your daily work directly to financial fortune.
*   **Verdict:** It is astrologically impossible for this period *not* to focus on money. The energy is concentrated entirely on your net worth.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive (MANDATORY)
This system confirms the "Ground Reality" of your salary growth:
*   **The Active Period:** You are in the **Aquarius Mahadasha** and **Capricorn Antardasha**.
*   **The Career Controller:** Aquarius contains your **Amatyakaraka (AmK)**, Mercury. Running the Mahadasha of the AmK is the primary signal for professional rising.
*   **The Status Trigger (AL):** The sub-period is Capricorn. Your **Arudha Lagna (AL)** is located in Capricorn. When the time-period hits the sign holding the AL, your reputation and "market value" increase.
*   **The Wealth Aspect:** From the Capricorn Antardasha, the sign aspects **Aries** (using Jaimini aspects). Aries contains your **Hora Lagna (HL)**, the specific point of financial wealth.
*   **Synthesis:** The activation of AmK (Career), AL (Status), and HL (Money) simultaneously is a "Double Confirmation" of salary growth.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define *how* this money comes:
*   **The "Shadow-Structure" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** This combination in your 2nd house often indicates income from **Foreign sources, MNCs, or Tech/AI sectors**. It suggests "unconventional" earning structures (e.g., stocks, bonuses) rather than just base salary.
*   **The "Dharma-Karma" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** Saturn (Work) is conjunct Jupiter (Management/Advisory). This indicates that your salary growth is tied to a role where you guide, teach, or manage others, rather than just executing tasks.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
*   **Vimshottari:** The **Jupiter Pratyantardasha**, sitting in your **2nd house**, brings the immediate financial trigger this month.
*   **Chara:** Confirmed by **Capricorn** Chara Antardasha (activating Arudha Lagna).
*   **Yogini:** You are in **Bhadrika (Mercury)** Mahadasha and **Ulka (Saturn)** Antardasha. Ulka represents "Labor and Effort." This confirms the raise comes through hard work, not luck alone.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D10 Dasamsa)
Your D10 chart is the "Fruit" of your career.
*   **10th House Power:** You have **Mercury Exalted** in Virgo in the 10th House of the D10 chart.
*   **Meaning:** This is a "Bhadra Yoga" in the career chart. It indicates high intelligence, analytical capability, and the potential to reach the very top of your field. Even if you feel stuck in the D1 (physical) chart, your D10 guarantees that your skill set is valued at a premium level.

### Nakshatra Insights
*   **Saturn in Purva Ashadha:** Your career lord is in the star of "Invincible Success" (Aparajita). This Nakshatra is symbolized by a winnowing basket, suggesting your career growth comes from refining processes—separating the wheat from the chaff.
*   **Jupiter in Magha:** The PD lord is in the star of "The Throne." This suggests that the salary increase is linked to a position of authority or lineage/tradition within the company.

### Timing & Guidance
*   **Immediate Window (Jan 2026 - April 2026):** This is your "Golden Window." The overlap of Jupiter PD and Capricorn AD (AL activation) is the strongest time to negotiate.
*   **Strategy:** Do not ask for a "raise"—ask for a "market correction" of your salary. With Rahu in the 2nd house, you can aim higher than standard percentages.
*   **Caution:** With Saturn/Rahu in the 2nd, ensure tax compliance and avoid "grey area" financial dealings. The growth is solid, but the path requires integrity.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are in a definitive "Wealth Cycle." The planets of salary (Saturn/Rahu/Jupiter) are all active and sitting in the House of Salary. The Jaimini signals confirm a rise in status. The stars support a bold move—make your case for a salary correction now.</div>
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?I am employed and want to ask about salary growth
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter** period (active now through early 2026) creates a massive "Wealth Convergence" in your chart. Specifically, expect significant salary discussions or a financial jump between **January and April 2026**, as your Arudha Lagna (Status) is activated by the Jaimini Chara Dasha. However, your D9 Navamsa shows Saturn in the 10th house, indicating this growth comes with increased responsibility or a heavier workload. **Action:** Leverage your technical or specialized skills now; the planets in your 2nd house support aggressive but polite negotiation for higher pay.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Wealth Cluster" Activation**: You are currently running the Dasha of **Saturn**, Antardasha of **Rahu**, and Pratyantardasha of **Jupiter**. In your birth chart, **ALL THREE** of these planets sit together in your **2nd House (Leo)**—the specific house of salary, savings, and accumulated wealth. This is a rare "Triple Trigger" for financial matters.
*   **Career Potential (D10 Chart)**: In your Dasamsa (Career) chart, your Amatyakaraka (Career Planet) **Mercury is Exalted in the 11th House** of gains. This is the strongest possible indicator for high earning potential in your professional life.
*   **The Challenge**: Saturn's presence in the 2nd house often makes one feel "underpaid" or restricted even when earning well. It demands that you "prove your worth" before releasing the reward.
*   **The Jaimini Secret**: You are currently in the **Capricorn Chara Antardasha** (until April 2026). Capricorn is your **Arudha Lagna (AL)**—the seat of your public status and reputation. When the AL is active, promotions and status upgrades are naturally triggered.

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View (The 2nd House Focus)
Your chart is currently dominated by a powerful planetary conjunction in **Leo (2nd House)** involving Saturn, Rahu, Jupiter, and Mars.
*   **Saturn (Mahadasha Lord)** represents your career karma. Sitting in the 2nd house, it links your profession directly to your bank balance.
*   **Rahu (Antardasha Lord)** is the planet of ambition and amplification. In the 2nd house, it creates a "hunger" for wealth and suggests that unconventional methods or bold negotiations will yield better results than standard increments.
*   **Jupiter (Pratyantardasha Lord)** governs the 9th house of luck. Its presence here acts as a catalyst, blessing your efforts with good fortune during this specific month.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive (MANDATORY)
*   **Arudha Lagna (AL) Activation**: Your current Chara Antardasha is **Capricorn**. Since Capricorn is your **Arudha Lagna (AL)**, this period brings your professional reputation into the spotlight.
*   **Wealth from AL**: The 2nd house from your active sign (Capricorn) is Aquarius, which holds your **Amatyakaraka (Mercury)**. In Jaimini astrology, having the Career Significator (AmK) in the 2nd house from the active time period is a classic **Dhana Yoga** (Wealth Combination) driven by professional skills.
*   **Sign Aspects**: The current Capricorn period aspects **Aries (10th House)**, **Cancer (Ascendant)**, and **Libra (4th House)**. The aspect on the 10th house (Aries) further energizes career activities.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career Wealth)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your career and income:
*   **The "Technical Management" Link (Saturn + Mars + Jupiter):** Saturn (Career) is conjoined with Mars (Technical skill) and Jupiter (Management/Advisory). This suggests your highest salary growth comes from roles that blend **technical expertise with leadership** or specialized consulting.
*   **The "Amplified Ambition" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** This combination often indicates income from **foreign sources, MNCs, or cutting-edge technology**. It also suggests that switching jobs (Rahu energy) often yields higher jumps than internal appraisals.
*   **The "Wealth Source" Link (Venus in Taurus):** Venus, the planet of money, is in its **Own Sign (Taurus)** in the **11th House of Gains**. This is a standalone promise of financial abundance, independent of career stress.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
*   **Vimshottari**: The **Jupiter Pratyantardasha**, sitting in your **2nd House**, brings immediate financial opportunities this month.
*   **Chara Dasha**: The **Capricorn Antardasha** (Active now until April 2026) activates your Arudha Lagna (Status).
*   **Yogini Dasha**: You are in the **Ulka (Saturn)** Antardasha. Ulka represents labor and pressure. This confirms that the salary hike will likely come with a demand for harder work or a more challenging role.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **From Lagna (Cancer):** The 2nd house (Salary) contains the massive 4-planet cluster.
*   **From Moon (Libra):** The same 4-planet cluster falls in the **11th House** from the Moon. The 11th house represents **Gains and Liquid Cash**. This is a "Double Confirmation" that your current timeline is incredibly lucrative.
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** The cluster falls in the 6th house, indicating that this wealth comes through service, solving problems, or overcoming competition.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D10 Dasamsa)
In your D10 Career Chart:
*   **Mercury (AmK)** is **Exalted in Virgo** in the **11th House**. This is the "Gold Standard" for career earnings. It implies that your specialized skills (Mercury) are your ticket to high income (11th house).
*   **Rahu (Current AD Lord)** is in the **10th House** of the D10 chart. This indicates a period of high ambition where you can break through previous career ceilings.

### Nakshatra Insights
*   **Saturn in Uttara Phalguni (Sun's Star):** The Sun rules your 2nd House (Wealth). Saturn here is working *for* your bank account, ensuring that discipline leads to payout.
*   **Rahu in Magha (Ketu's Star):** Magha represents "The Throne." Rahu here creates a desire for authority and recognition. You aren't just looking for money; you want the status that comes with it.
*   **Jupiter in Magha:** Enhances the desire for a "Royal" or respected position.

### Timing & Guidance
**Critical Window:** **Now through April 2026**.
The convergence of the Jupiter PD (Vimshottari) and the Capricorn AD (Jaimini) makes this the most potent window for salary negotiation in recent years.

**Actionable Advice:**
1.  **Negotiate on Value, Not Need:** With Mars in the 2nd house, avoid being aggressive in speech. Use data (Mercury AmK) to prove your value.
2.  **Leverage the "Ulka" Energy:** Since Yogini Ulka signifies workload, volunteer for the "difficult" project. The stars favor wealth through solving hard problems right now.
3.  **Check Foreign/MNC Options:** The Rahu influence supports income from non-local sources. If you are in tech or engineering (Saturn+Mars), look for global roles.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your chart is screaming "Financial Focus" right now. The universe has placed your Dasha lords in the house of money to force you to address your earning power. The alignment is excellent for growth, provided you are willing to handle the increased responsibility (Saturn) that comes with the reward.</div>

        
        Current question: "What does my birth chart say about my career?I am employed and want to ask about salary growth"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:

        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles

        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Questions involving 'when', 'growth', or 'timing' → ALWAYS set needs_transits: true
        - Career questions about promotions/hikes → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",

                }
