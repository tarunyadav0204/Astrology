Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The year 2026 marks a significant **"Health Reset"** divided into two distinct phases. The first quarter (Jan-April) requires high vigilance regarding diet and inflammation as the Saturn-Rahu period peaks. However, a major shift occurs after **April 2026**, when the onset of the Jupiter <term id="antardasha">Antardasha</term> and Jupiter's transit into your Ascendant (Cancer) triggers a powerful recovery phase. While your <term id="d1">D1 Chart</term> shows sensitivity in the "Leo sector" (digestion/vitality), your <term id="d9">D9</term> strength ensures resilience. **Action:** Prioritize an anti-inflammatory diet and schedule a dental/ENT checkup before March 2026.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Leo Cluster" Sensitivity:** Your 2nd house (Leo) contains a massive planetary congestion (Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Rahu). This makes you prone to "heat" related issues—acidity, inflammation, or dental/throat sensitivities—specifically when triggered in early 2026.
*   **The April Turning Point:** The transition from the challenging Rahu <term id="antardasha">Antardasha</term> to the healing Jupiter <term id="antardasha">Antardasha</term> in April serves as a cosmic pivot, moving you from "diagnosis/confusion" to "treatment/healing."
*   **Yogini Confirmation:** The "Ulka" (Saturn) <term id="yogini">Yogini</term> period running until July 2026 confirms that health requires work and discipline (Saturn) rather than just luck during the first half of the year.
*   **Saturn's Protective Transit:** Saturn moving through Pisces (6th from your Moon) is a classic "Victory over Disease" position, suggesting that while symptoms may arise, you have the strength to conquer them.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)**
Your <term id="d1">D1 Chart</term> features the 6th Lord of Health (<term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term>) placed in the 2nd House (Leo) alongside Mars, Saturn, and Rahu. This is a "Pitta" (Fire) dominant combination affecting the face, throat, and dietary intake.
*   **Vulnerability:** The conjunction of Mars (Inflammation) and Saturn (Chronic) in Leo (Heart/Stomach) suggests a need to manage blood pressure and acidity.
*   **Strength:** <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> in the 8th house creates a <term id="vipareetarajayoga">Vipareeta Raja Yoga</term> (Success through adversity), indicating that health scares often turn out to be false alarms or manageable with intelligence.

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)**
*   **January - April 2026 (Saturn-Rahu):** This is the most sensitive window. Rahu is in the 2nd house cluster, amplifying "phantom symptoms" or anxiety about health. Diagnoses may be unclear during this time.
*   **April - December 2026 (Saturn-Jupiter):** Jupiter is the 6th Lord (Health) but also the 9th Lord (Grace). This period brings the right doctor, the right treatment, or a successful lifestyle change. The focus shifts from "worry" to "solution."

**3. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your health patterns:
*   **The "Agni-Stambhana" Link (Mars + Saturn):** Mars represents heat/inflammation, while Saturn represents blockage. In the sign of Leo, this specifically points to **gastric inflammation** or **stiffness in the upper spine/neck**. It is not a systemic disease but a "mechanical" or "dietary" blockage.
*   **The "Shadow-Expander" Link (Jupiter + Rahu):** This indicates that your body reacts strongly to "foreign substances"—this could be allergies, intolerance to new medications, or sensitivity to processed foods. 2026 is the year to clean up your intake.

**4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **From Lagna (Cancer):** The 6th Lord is in the 2nd House. Result: Health issues stem directly from **food habits**.
*   **From Moon (Libra):** Saturn transits the 6th house (Pisces). Result: **Excellent resilience**. Saturn here destroys disease and increases immunity.
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** The natal 6th house (Leo) contains the heavy planetary cluster. Result: **Vitality fluctuation**. You may feel tired easily; rest is mandatory.
*   **Verdict:** Since 2 out of 3 perspectives show management rather than crisis, the confidence level is **High (80%)** that this is a manageable maintenance period, not a critical failure.

**5. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
*   **Chara Dasha Trigger:** In April 2026, you shift from the **Aquarius** period (8th house of chronic issues) to the **Capricorn** period. Capricorn is ruled by your <term id="atmakaraka">Atmakaraka</term> (Saturn). This confirms that health in 2026 is Karmic—it will improve strictly in proportion to your discipline.
*   **Yogini Confirmation:** The <term id="yogini">Yogini</term> is **Ulka** (Saturn) until July, then **Siddha** (Venus). The first half is laborious; the second half (Siddha) brings ease and comfort.

### Nakshatra Insights
*   **Saturn in Purva Ashadha:** Your <term id="mahadasha">Mahadasha</term> lord is in **Purva Ashadha** <term id="nakshatra">Nakshatra</term> (ruled by Venus). This connects health directly to the kidneys and hydration. Ensure you are drinking enough water, as this star is related to the "Water Element" (Apas).
*   **Mars in Magha:** The inflammation trigger is in **Magha** (ruled by Ketu). This suggests that some health issues may be genetic or inherited (Pitra). Look at your family history regarding blood pressure/heart health for clues.

### Timing & Guidance
*   **Critical Window:** **March 2026** (Mars Transit + Dasha Junction). Avoid elective surgeries or extreme physical exertion during this month.
*   **Recovery Phase:** **July 2026 onwards**. Jupiter's transit into Cancer (your Ascendant) will act as a "shield," boosting immunity and physical vitality significantly.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: 2026 is a year of "Biological Cleanup." The stars are forcing you to address dietary habits and inflammation that have built up over time. The Dasha shift in April is your saving grace, turning a period of stress into a period of healing. Trust your body's resilience, but do not ignore its signals in the first quarter.</div>

Q: mental well being
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current period (Saturn <term id="mahadasha">Mahadasha</term> + Rahu <term id="antardasha">Antardasha</term>) marks a high-intensity phase where your career is undergoing a "structural renovation." Specifically, the time between **September 2025 and July 2026** is critical as the <term id="yogini">Yogini</term> "Ulka" (Saturn) period triggers a major shift in your professional responsibilities, likely pushing you toward a more technical, advisory, or specialized role. However, your <term id="d9">D9</term> <term id="navamsa">Navamsa</term> shows your 10th Lord Mars in its own sign (Aries), indicating that despite current workplace pressure or office politics, your capacity for leadership is unbreakable. **Action:** Focus on wealth management, technical consulting, or specialized analytics now, as your chart supports earnings through intellect rather than just labor.</div>

### Key Insights

*   **The "Wealth Engine" Yoga:** You have a rare 4-planet conjunction in your 2nd House (Leo) involving Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu. This links your career (10th Lord Mars) directly to wealth storage (2nd House), suggesting your career is destined to be lucrative but high-pressure.
*   **The Jaimini Confirmation:** Your current <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term> is **Aquarius (2020-2026)**. Aquarius contains your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (Mercury - the Career Planet). This is a "Double Confirmation" that career is the central theme of this 6-year chapter, often bringing success through research, technology, or managing others' resources (8th house energy).
*   **The D10 Professional Peak:** While your main chart shows struggle, your <term id="d10">D10</term> (Career Chart) features an **Exalted Mercury** in the 10th House. This is a "Rags to Riches" signal—your professional reputation will eventually be defined by supreme intelligence, communication, or analytical mastery.
*   **The Conflict:** The Saturn-Rahu-Mars conjunction creates a "pressure cooker" environment. You likely face friction with authority or intense competition, but this friction is exactly what polishes your skills.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)**
Your career foundation is defined by the **Dharma-Karma Adhipati Yoga** formed by the conjunction of the 10th Lord (Mars) and the 9th Lord (Jupiter) in the 2nd House. This is one of the most powerful combinations for success, indicating that your work is tied to advisory, banking, management, or technical leadership. However, the presence of Saturn and Rahu here adds a "Shrapit" (cursed) undertone, meaning success comes after delays or handling difficult, complex problems that others avoid.

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)**
You are currently in the **Saturn Mahadasha** and **Rahu Antardasha**.
*   **Saturn (The Taskmaster):** As your 7th and 8th lord in the 2nd house, Saturn demands discipline in speech and finance.
*   **Rahu (The Catalyst):** Rahu amplifies ambition but creates illusion. In Leo, it pushes you toward unconventional paths or working with foreign/modern technologies.
*   **Synthesis:** Saturn-Rahu periods often bring a feeling of "being trapped" in a role just before a sudden breakthrough. Do not quit impulsively; build the bridge to the next role carefully.

**3. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your work:

*   **The "Technical Master" Link (Saturn + Mars):** Saturn (Karma) is conjoined Mars (Technology/Engineering). This specifically indicates success in technical fields, machinery, engineering, or executing aggressive strategies. You are not meant for passive desk jobs; you need "action-oriented" logic.
*   **The "Brahma Yoga" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** Saturn touches Jupiter, the planet of wisdom. This modifies the hard labor of Saturn into "Advisory" or "Management" roles. You will succeed by teaching, consulting, or guiding teams, not just doing the grunt work.
*   **The "Foreign/Shadow" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** This connection strongly suggests career involvement with foreign companies, shadow tech (backend/coding), or unconventional industries.

**4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **10th from Lagna (Cancer):** Aries (Ruled by Mars). Shows an energetic, competitive, and pioneer-like approach to work.
*   **10th from Moon (Libra):** Cancer. Indicates a need for emotional connection to the work or public dealing.
*   **10th from Sun (Pisces):** Sagittarius (Ruled by Jupiter). Indicates that at the soul level, you seek a role that offers wisdom, teaching, or moral authority.
*   **Verdict:** Since 2 out of 3 perspectives point to fiery/dharma signs (Aries/Sagittarius) ruled by Mars/Jupiter, your career must align with "Technical Leadership" or "Principled Management" to satisfy you.

**5. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
The Vimshottari prediction of a "high-pressure transition" is confirmed by:
*   **Chara Dasha:** You are in the **Aquarius** period (ending April 2026). Since Aquarius contains your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (Mercury), this final year of the cycle is the "Result Giving" year where professional status is cemented.
*   **Yogini Dasha:** You are running **Bhadrika (Mercury)** Mahadasha and **Ulka (Saturn)** Antardasha. The Mercury influence (Dec 2024 - 2029) is excellent because Mercury is Exalted in your D10 chart. This confirms that despite the Saturn-Rahu stress, the underlying current is pushing you toward your highest professional peak.

**6. The Synthesis (D1 vs D9/D10)**
*   **D1 (Root):** Shows a congested, stressful work environment (4 planets in one house).
*   **D9 (Strength):** Mars is in its **Own Sign (Aries)**. This provides "Neecha Bhanga" (cancellation of weakness) to any Saturn affliction. You have the inner resilience of a warrior.
*   **D10 (Fruit):** Exalted Mercury in the 10th House is the final arbiter. It guarantees that your career narrative ends in recognition for your intellect and skills.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your 10th House cusp falls in **Ashwini** (ruled by Ketu) or **Bharani** (ruled by Venus) depending on degrees, but your 10th Lord Mars is in **Magha** (ruled by Ketu).
*   **Magha Nakshatra:** The symbol is a "Throne." This indicates that you are not meant to be a subordinate forever. You have a deep karmic need for autonomy and authority. Working under micromanagement will be toxic for your health. Magha requires you to connect with "legacy" or "established hierarchies" to succeed.

### Timing & Guidance
*   **Immediate Phase (Now - April 2026):** The overlap of Saturn-Rahu (Vimshottari) and the end of Aquarius (Chara Dasha) marks a "clearing of the deck." Expect unexpected changes or restructuring.
*   **The Golden Period (Post-April 2026):** As you enter the **Capricorn** Chara Dasha, which aspects your 10th house (Aries) via Rashi Drishti, and move deeper into the Mercury Yogini cycle, professional stability returns.
*   **Guidance:** Your wealth is in your "throat" and "intellect" (2nd House focus). Focus on roles that require negotiation, consulting, specialized coding/engineering, or financial advisory. Avoid impulsive conflict with superiors (Mars/Saturn war), as you are currently in a period where patience pays higher dividends than aggression.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are currently in a "pressure-test" phase designed to upgrade your career from "Worker" (Saturn) to "Master" (Jupiter/Mercury). The stress you feel is the friction of growth. Lean into your technical and advisory skills (Mars+Jupiter) and trust that your D10 Exalted Mercury promises a high-status outcome.</div>

        Current question: "What does my birth chart say about my career?"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge

        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2027

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
