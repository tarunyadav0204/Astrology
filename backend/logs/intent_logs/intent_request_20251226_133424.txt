Q: Tell me about my husband's health in 2026
A: Based on your birth chart and the derived **Bhavat Bhavam** (House-from-House) principles, here is the astrological health roadmap for your husband in 2026.

<div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: 
The year 2026 is a **"Karmic Health Reset"** for your husband, specifically between **January 14 and July 8, 2026**. During this time, the planetary focus shifts to **gut health, diagnostic clarity, and immunity** rather than physical injury.

**Specifically, expect sensitivity regarding digestion or blood circulation** as Saturn transits his derived 2nd house (your 8th). However, since Jupiter transits the favorable 11th house (his recovery sector) starting mid-year, this indicates **effective treatment and recovery** after an initial period of confusion. 

**Action:** Ensure he gets a full preventative check-up in **February 2026**, focusing on "hidden" or inflammation-based markers, as the Ketu influence can mask symptoms.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The Husband Indicator (7th Lord Saturn):** Saturn acts as the primary health indicator for your spouse. Its placement in your 2nd House (Virgo) suggests his health is linked to diet and nervous system regulation.
*   **The D9 Strength (Inner Resilience):** In your Navamsa (D9), Saturn is debilitated in Aries. This suggests that while he may look strong outwardly, his internal immunity is sensitive to stress. He needs rest more than he admits.
*   **The Jaimini Confirmation:** The active **Aquarius Chara Dasha** (your 7th House) activates the spouse directly. Since Aquarius contains Mercury (significator of nerves/skin), these are the areas to watch.
*   **The Challenge:** The **Saturn-Ketu** period (Jan–July 2026) creates a "diagnostic fog"—symptoms may be vague or shifting.

### Astrological Analysis

#### 1. The Promise (Bhavat Bhavam & Chart Analysis)
Using the principle of **Bhavat Bhavam**, we analyze the **7th House (Aquarius)** as his Ascendant.
*   **His 6th House (Disease):** From Aquarius, the 6th house is **Cancer** (your 12th house). This creates a link between his health and water-related issues (lymphatic system, phlegm, emotional stress).
*   **His 8th House (Longevity/Surgery):** From Aquarius, the 8th house is **Virgo** (your 2nd house), where your Saturn sits. Saturn here creates resilience but indicates a tendency towards chronic, slow-developing issues rather than sudden acute ones.

#### 2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)
You are running the **Saturn Mahadasha**, which focuses entirely on the 7th House (Spouse) matters.
*   **Saturn-Ketu Antardasha (Jan 2026 – July 2026):** This is the most sensitive period. Ketu is in your 6th House (Capricorn), which acts as the **12th House from the 7th**. Astrologically, the "12th from the 7th" indicates hospital visits, isolation, or sleep disturbances for the spouse.
*   **Saturn-Venus Antardasha (July 2026 onwards):** Venus is in your 8th House (Pisces). While this sounds difficult, Venus is **Exalted**. This signifies "Recovery through Medicine." The second half of the year brings the right doctors and healing methods.

#### 3. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
This timeline is confirmed by the **Aquarius** Chara Dasha (activating the husband directly) and the **Sankata (Rahu)** Yogini Dasha running until March 2026.
*   **Sankata** often brings sudden anxiety or confusion. Combined with Ketu in the Vimshottari, this confirms that **January–March** requires patience with medical diagnoses. Do not panic if tests are inconclusive; seek a second opinion.

#### 4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **From Lagna (Leo):** Saturn (7th Lord) is in the 2nd house. Health issues stem from food/diet.
*   **From Moon (Virgo):** The 7th from Moon is Pisces, containing Sun, Mars, and Venus. This is a "Hot" combination. It suggests potential blood pressure or inflammation (Pitta) issues for the husband.
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** The 7th from Sun is Virgo (Saturn). This confirms the joint/bone or "dryness" (Vata) influence.
*   **Verdict:** Since 2 out of 3 perspectives involve Saturn/Virgo, the core root of health issues in 2026 is **Vata-Pitta imbalance**—stress affecting digestion and inflammation.

#### 5. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the *type* of health influence:

*   **The "Saturn + Mars" Karmic Trigger:** In 2026, Transit Saturn (in Pisces) will cross over your natal Mars (in Pisces). In Nadi, Mars represents the physical vitality of the male partner.
    *   **Effect:** When Saturn (Pressure) touches Mars (Blood/Vitality), it creates a period of **low energy, potential blood pressure fluctuation, or surgery**.
    *   **Timing:** This is active all year but peaks when Mars also transits Pisces in **June/July 2026**.
*   **The "Mars + Venus" Link:** Natal Mars is with Venus in the 8th house. This specific combination in a water sign (Pisces) often indicates sensitivity in the **kidneys, bladder, or fluid regulation**.

---

### Practical Guidance

**1. The "Ketu" Strategy (Jan – July 2026):**
*   Since Ketu obscures diagnosis, if he feels unwell, do not just treat symptoms. Look for root causes (e.g., food intolerances, latent infections).
*   **Remedy:** He should avoid self-medication. Ketu rules "unconventional" healing—homeopathy or ayurveda may work better than harsh antibiotics during this window.

**2. Diet & Lifestyle:**
*   With the Virgo/Pisces axis active, his digestion is the weak link. Implement a warm, cooked-food diet. Avoid raw foods and excessive sugar in early 2026.

**3. Spiritual Remedy:**
*   Since Saturn rules his health in your chart, performing **Seva (Service)** on Saturdays (donating food to the elderly or disabled) helps neutralize the "Maraka" energy of Saturn in the 2nd house.

Q: Tell me about my husband's health in 2026
A: Based on your birth chart and the derived astrological houses for your husband (Bhavat Bhavam), here is the detailed health roadmap for him in 2026.

<div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: 
The year 2026 indicates a period of **"Diagnostic Sensitivity & Habit Correction"** for your husband. While there is no indication of a crisis, the planetary energy shifts from "low vitality/fatigue" in the first half of the year to "digestive & lifestyle management" in the second half.

**Specifically, keep a close watch between January 15 and May 11, 2026.**
During this Saturn-Ketu window, he may feel physically drained, experience sleep issues, or face hard-to-diagnose aches. However, **Jupiter’s aspect on his derived Ascendant throughout the year** acts as a powerful "Divine Guard," ensuring that any issue that arises is treatable and manageable.

**Action:** Focus on his gut health and sleep routine immediately.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The Husband's Lagna Focus (Aquarius Period):** Your current Chara Dasha is **Aquarius**, which happens to be the sign of your 7th House (Husband). This means the spotlight is entirely on him—his health and career are the central themes of your life right now.
*   **The "Shadow" Influence (Rahu in Derived 6th):** In the derived chart, Rahu sits in his 6th house (Illness sector). This typically indicates issues related to **allergies, gut sensitivity, or anxiety** that are often misdiagnosed as heart or structural issues.
*   **The Protection (Jupiter's Shield):** Jupiter is transiting Gemini (your 11th house), which places it in his derived 5th house. From here, Jupiter casts a protective aspect directly onto his Ascendant (Aquarius). This is the strongest protection available in astrology—it implies good medical advice and recovery.
*   **Strength Check:** His Lagna Lord (Saturn) is in his 8th house (Virgo) in your chart. While this suggests he may have a "sensitive constitution" or chronic concerns, it grants high longevity (Ayush).

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Derived Chart Analysis)**
Using the **Bhavat Bhavam** principle, we rotate your chart to make the 7th House (Aquarius) the Ascendant for your husband.
*   **His Lagna Lord (Saturn):** Is placed in Virgo (his derived 8th house). This indicates that his health relies heavily on **dietary discipline** (Virgo). It also suggests that stress tends to manifest as digestive or nerve-related issues for him.
*   **His 6th House (Illness):** Contains Rahu in Cancer. Cancer rules the stomach and chest. Rahu here suggests sensitivity to certain foods or water retention.

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)**
You are currently in **Saturn Mahadasha**. Since Saturn is your husband's Lagna Lord, his well-being is tied to your Dasha.
*   **Saturn-Ketu Antardasha (Jan 2026 – May 2026):**
    *   Ketu is in Capricorn, which is your husband's **12th House** (Sleep, Feet, Hospitalization).
    *   *Prediction:* This is the most sensitive window. He may feel "burnt out," struggle with insomnia, or deal with foot/ankle pain. It is a period for rest, not high exertion.
*   **Saturn-Venus Antardasha (May 2026 – Dec 2026):**
    *   Venus is the Yoga Karaka (Best Planet) for your husband's chart.
    *   *Prediction:* A significant recovery period. Vitality returns, but be mindful of sugar intake or kidney function (Venus significations), as Venus is in Pisces (his 2nd house of food).

**3. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
This timeline is double-confirmed by the **Aquarius** Chara Dasha (activating his Lagna) and the **Sankata (Rahu)** Yogini Dasha running until March 2026. Rahu creates a "foggy" atmosphere regarding diagnosis, meaning second opinions are necessary if he feels unwell in Q1 2026.

**4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **From Lagna (Body):** The 7th lord Saturn is in the 2nd house, connecting husband's health to your family life and food.
*   **From Moon (Mind):** The 7th from Moon is Pisces. Saturn transiting Pisces (his derived 2nd house) suggests a "Sade Sati" like pressure on his health—mental stress causing physical symptoms.
*   **From Sun (Soul):** The 7th from Sun is Virgo. Natal Saturn is here. This confirms that his health is a "karmic focus" involving long-term management rather than a sudden event.
*   *Verdict:* Since 3 out of 3 perspectives show Saturn/Virgo influence, the focus is clearly on **Digestion and Stress Management**.

**5. Nadi Precision (The Nature of His Health)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi links that define *why* he gets sick:

*   **The "Saturn + Moon" Link (Cold/Water):** Saturn (Husband) is conjunct Moon. In Nadi, this indicates susceptibility to "Cold" diseases—sinus issues, water retention, or chest congestion. He should avoid cold foods in winter/spring.
*   **The "Saturn + Jupiter" Link (Jeevakaraka):** Saturn is also conjunct Jupiter. This is an excellent protection. It indicates that "natural healing," holistic remedies, or a change in diet (Jupiter) will be more effective for him than heavy antibiotics.
*   **The "Rahu in Cancer" Link:** Rahu in the sign of the Moon (Cancer) creates a sensitivity to toxins. He should potentially check for food intolerances (gluten/dairy) in 2026.

### Practical Guidance

**Action Plan for 2026:**
1.  **Q1 Strategy (Jan-March):** Do not ignore fatigue. If he feels tired, he must rest. The Ketu influence in his 12th house requires sleep hygiene.
2.  **Dietary Shift:** With the strong Virgo emphasis (Saturn in Virgo), his health is 80% diet. Introduce warm, cooked foods; reduce raw salads and cold drinks.
3.  **Medical Checkup:** Schedule a routine checkup in **April 2026** (when Venus dasha begins) to clear any doubts from the Ketu period. Focus on blood sugar and cholesterol.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your husband is not facing a danger to his longevity in 2026. He is facing a year where his body demands a slower pace and cleaner fuel. The first half of the year is for rest; the second half is for rejuvenation.</div>

        Current question: "How is my health next year?"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles

        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2027

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
