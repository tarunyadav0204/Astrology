Q: In general
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your academic outlook for the next three months is exceptionally promising but demands disciplined labor over mere luck. According to **Phaladeepika**, the placement of your <term id="lagna-lord">Lagna Lord</term> <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> in its <term id="own-sign">Own Sign</term> (Pisces) in the 4th house forms a powerful <term id="hamsa-yoga">Hamsa Yoga</term>, granting you the wisdom and mental clarity needed for high-stakes examinations. This is further bolstered by your **Varshphal 2026** which places the **Muntha** in the 4th house, specifically focusing your destiny on education this year. While your <term id="vimshottari">Vimshottari Dasha</term> of Jupiter-Rahu can occasionally create mental "smoke" or distractions, the current **Mercury Pratyantardasha** (sitting in your 11th house) provides the intellectual "gains" and networking support needed to excel. Expect a "Karmic Trigger" as transit <term id="saturn">Saturn</term> crosses your natal Jupiter in your 4th house—this indicates that while the workload will be heavy and "Saturnine" in its pressure, the resulting "Wisdom through Hardship" will ensure a very strong performance in your 10th Board exams.</div>

### Key Insights
• **Academic Focus**: The **Muntha** in the 4th house (Education) confirms that 2026 is a pivotal year for your academic foundation.
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (<term id="moon">Moon</term>) sits in the 3rd house of "Personal Efforts," indicating that your success is directly tied to your writing skills and repeated practice.
• **Karmic Activation**: Transit Saturn is currently hitting your natal Jupiter at 1.02° Pisces. This is a once-in-30-years "Wisdom Trigger," forcing you to master your subjects through deep discipline.
• **Ashtakavarga Warning**: Your 5th house (Aries) holds only **23 bindus**, indicating low natural support for "easy" learning; you must not rely on shortcuts.

### Astrological Analysis
The root of your success lies in the strength of your 4th and 11th houses. According to **BPHS**, a strong 4th house ensures a solid grasp of fundamentals, while the 11th house (where your 5th lord <term id="mars">Mars</term> resides) ensures the fruition of your desires.

#### The Parashari View
Your <term id="lagna">Lagna</term> is Sagittarius, with <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> in the 4th house. This creates a highly stable mental environment. The 5th lord of intelligence, <term id="mars">Mars</term>, is placed in the 11th house of gains, forming a <term id="raj-yoga">Kendra-Trikona Raj Yoga</term> with <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> (7th and 10th lord). According to **Saravali**, this combination indicates "one who is highly intelligent and gains through his own mental prowess." The <term id="ashtakavarga">Ashtakavarga</term> shows **30 points** for the 4th house, indicating strong support for academic environment, though the 5th house at **23 points** warns of potential fatigue or lack of concentration if not managed.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
You are currently running the **Libra Chara Mahadasha** and the **Sagittarius Chara Antardasha** (Sign ID 8). According to the **Jaimini Sutras**, the Sagittarius period aspects your 4th house of Pisces (ID 11), your 7th house of Gemini (ID 2), and your 9th house of Leo (ID 5). 
- **Confirmation**: The aspect on Pisces activates your <term id="darakaraka">Darakaraka</term> (Jupiter), which in Jaimini acts as a "supportive partner" to your soul's goals.
- **Talent**: With <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> and <term id="venus">Venus</term> in the 11th from <term id="arudha-lagna">Arudha Lagna</term> (Capricorn), your "Dhana Yoga Status" is strong, meaning your intelligence will eventually lead to significant status.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Studies)
Your chart reveals a specific Nadi connection between **Saturn and Jupiter**. This is the **"Dharma-Karma Adhipati" Link**, suggesting that your studies are not just for marks, but for a higher purpose. 
- **The "Intellectual Cluster" Link (Sun + Mercury + Mars + Venus)**: In your 11th house, this cluster indicates a "Multi-tasker" mindset. You have the ability to switch between subjects (Mercury) with the aggression of a competitor (Mars). 
- **NADI AGE TRIGGER**: At age 15-16, your chart enters the **Rohini** activation zone. Since <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> is internally strong, this age triggers a "growth spurt" in your cognitive abilities.

#### Timing Synthesis
This academic success is confirmed by your **Sagittarius Chara Dasha** activating your 4th house and your **Siddha Yogini Dasha** (Lord: <term id="venus">Venus</term>), which brings "Success, Luxury, and Knowledge."
- **Vimshottari PD**: Your **Mercury Pratyantardasha** (sitting in your 11th house) runs through the end of January, bringing a sharp focus on logic. 
- **Mudda Dasha (Varshphal)**: From Feb 3rd to March 24th, you enter the **Jupiter Mudda Dasha**. Since Jupiter is your Year Lord's friend and your natal Lagna Lord, this 7-week window is your "Golden Period" for exam preparation.
- **Verdict**: Since this success appears in **3 out of 3 charts** (Lagna/Moon/Sun), the confidence level is **95%**—expect a breakthrough result if you maintain discipline.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
- **Lagna Chart**: Shows physical effort in the 11th house (Mars/Sun).
- **Chandra Lagna**: Examines the mind. From the Moon (Aquarius), your 5th house of studies (Gemini) contains <term id="ketu">Ketu</term>. This warns of "silly mistakes" or lack of attention to detail.
- **Surya Lagna**: From the Sun (Libra), the 10th house of "Result" (Cancer) contains the <term id="indu-lagna">Indu Lagna</term>, promising a "wealth" of success in the final outcome.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D24)
In your **D24 (Chaturvimsamsa)**, the chart of specific knowledge, **Jupiter is Exalted** in the 1st house. According to **Uttara Kalamrita**, an exalted planet in the D24 Lagna indicates "one who becomes a master of his chosen field." However, **Mars is debilitated** there, suggesting that while you have the knowledge (Jupiter), you might struggle with the "speed" or "aggression" (Mars) of the exam environment. Practice timed mock tests to overcome this.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your birth <term id="nakshatra">Nakshatra</term> is **Purva Bhadrapada**, ruled by Jupiter. According to **Hora Sara**, those born under this star are "skilled in earning through intellectual means." 
- **Current Transit**: Saturn is transiting **Uttara Bhadrapada**, which is your **Vipat Tara** (Danger/Obstacle). **Saturn is transiting in Uttara Bhadrapada, which is your Vipat Tara from your birth Moon in Shatabhisha. This creates danger and obstacles.** This specifically warns against overconfidence. Treat every mark as a battle to be won.

### Timing & Guidance
• **Feb 3 - March 24**: Your highest-performing window. This is the **Jupiter Mudda Dasha**. Complete your most difficult subjects during this time.
• **March 24 onwards**: The **Saturn Mudda Dasha** begins. The pressure will feel heavy. Avoid burnout by maintaining a strict sleep schedule.
• **Remedy**: Since your 5th house is weak in Ashtakavarga, offer water to the Sun (<term id="surya-arghya">Surya Arghya</term>) daily to boost your "Atma-Bala" (Self-confidence).

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are currently in a "Sudarshana Triple Hit" phase where your Dasha, Varshphal Muntha, and Divisional Strength all point toward academic excellence. The only hurdle is the "Vipat Tara" influence of Saturn—manage your time with military discipline, and the Hamsa Yoga will deliver a result that sets the stage for a brilliant future.</div>
Q: In general
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your studies over the next three months will be characterized by a high degree of intellectual expansion and success, though requiring disciplined effort. According to **Jaimini Sutras**, your current **Sagittarius Chara Antardasha** activates your natal <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> (the <term id="darakaraka">Darakaraka</term>), signaling a period of internal growth. Since your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (Moon) is well-placed, your status as a student remains strong. The **Siddha Yogini** dasha (Venus) ensures that despite some pressure, you will experience "Siddha" or fulfillment of your academic goals.</div>

### Key Insights
• **Intellectual Edge**: The <term id="pd">Pratyantardasha</term> of <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> in the 11th house creates a sharp, communicative edge, ideal for networking and scoring well in viva or presentations.
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your chart shows a **Jaimini Raj Yoga (AK+AmK)** involving <term id="mars">Mars</term> and the <term id="moon">Moon</term>. This provides you with the soul-level drive to excel and gain authority in your peer group.
• **Classical Reference**: According to **Phaladeepika**, a strong <term id="hamsa-yoga">Hamsa Yoga</term> (Jupiter in a <term id="kendra">Kendra</term>) makes the native wise, virtuous, and respected—perfect for academic distinction.

### Astrological Analysis
The next three months represent a vital period of academic foundation. Your <term id="lagna">Lagna</term> is <term id="sagittarius">Sagittarius</term>, ruled by a powerful, retrograde <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> in the 4th house of education.

#### The Parashari View
In the D1 chart, your 5th house of intelligence (Aries) is ruled by <term id="mars">Mars</term>, which is placed in the 11th house of gains. The **Ashtakavarga shows 23 points for the 5th house**, indicating that competitive exams or creative projects may require more "sweat equity" than usual. However, your 4th house (basic education) has **30 points**, showing a very strong foundation and support from teachers.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
According to the **Jaimini Sutras**, your <term id="kl">Karkamsa Lagna</term> is <term id="gemini">Gemini</term>. The presence of <term id="ketu">Ketu</term> here, aspected by Jupiter, confirms a **natural affinity for Mathematics, Coding, or Astrology**. Your <term id="al">Arudha Lagna</term> is in <term id="capricorn">Capricorn</term>; with the Moon in the 2nd from it, your public reputation as a "bright student" is well-protected.

#### Nadi Precision
Your chart reveals a significant **Nadi Link** involving **Saturn + Mercury**:
- **The "Commercial Intelligence" Link (<term id="saturn">Saturn</term> + <term id="mercury">Mercury</term>):** This indicates your learning style is practical, business-oriented, and focused on communication. It suggests you will excel in subjects requiring logic and structured data.
- **Jupiter's Retrograde Reach:** Because Jupiter is <term id="retro">retrograde</term>, it also links to your <term id="moon">Moon</term> in <term id="aquarius">Aquarius</term>, giving you a "double-layered" intuition when solving complex problems.

#### Timing Synthesis
This timing is confirmed by your **Sagittarius Chara Antardasha**, which (according to `sign_aspects[8]`) aspects Gemini (ID 2), Virgo (ID 5), and Pisces (ID 11). By aspecting Pisces, the dasha lord activates your natal Jupiter, the lord of your education.
- **Vimshottari**: You are in **Jupiter-Rahu-Mercury**. The <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> <term id="pd">Pratyantardasha</term>, sitting in your **11th house**, brings networking skills and gains through intelligence to this month.
- **Yogini**: You are in the **Siddha (Venus)** period, which brings a "vibe" of success, luxury, and knowledge.
- **Synthesis**: The **Siddha Yogini** lord (Venus) is in your 11th house, perfectly aligning with your Mercury PD for academic gains.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
- **Lagna Chart**: Jupiter in 4th (Strong academic foundation).
- **Chandra Lagna**: 5th house contains <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> and <term id="sun">Sun</term> (Brilliant intellect, though Sun is <term id="debilitated">debilitated</term>).
- **Surya Lagna**: 4th house contains <term id="saturn">Saturn</term> (Disciplined, slow-but-steady learning).
**Verdict**: Since positive academic indicators appear in 2 out of 3 charts, the confidence level for success is **66%**—expect significant progress provided you maintain discipline.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D9 Navamsa)
In the **Navamsa**, your Jupiter is **Exalted** in <term id="cancer">Cancer</term> (House 12). While in a <term id="dusthana">Dusthana</term>, the exaltation provides "internal resilience." According to **Uttara Kalamrita**, a planet weak in D1 (Jupiter is at 1.02° - Mrit Avastha) but strong in D9 shows a "Phoenix-like rise." You might start the semester feeling unprepared, but your inner wisdom will carry you to the finish line.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your birth <term id="nakshatra">Nakshatra</term> is **Purva Bhadrapada**, ruled by Jupiter. This nakshatra is associated with transformation and "fire." 
- **Current Transit**: Saturn is transiting in **Uttara Bhadrapada**, which is your **Vipat Tara** from your birth Moon in Shatabhisha. This creates danger and obstacles. 
- **The Ashtakavarga Filter**: Saturn transits your 4th house (Pisces), which has **30 SAV points**. While the house is strong, Saturn's presence in a Vipat Tara suggests that your "comfort zone" or "study environment" may feel restricted or under pressure.

### Timing & Guidance
**NADI AGE TRIGGER**: Age 15-16 activates **Rohini** nakshatra themes. This is a "growth" trigger, suggesting that this specific year is a turning point where you move from basic learning to specialized interests.

**KARMIC LANDMINE Alert**: Your <term id="rahu">Rahu</term> at 12.2° Sagittarius falls on the **Mrityu Bhaga** (Death Degree) with 0.8° orb. In your 1st house, this creates a karmic wound regarding "focus." You may feel scattered or prone to headaches/distractions. 

**Remedies**:
1. **Strengthen Jupiter**: Since Jupiter is in **Pushkara Navamsa** (Degree of Nourishment), wearing yellow or honoring a teacher will unlock "miraculous" academic help.
2. **Mercury Alignment**: To help the debilitated Sun (lord of 9th), focus on self-reliance. Don't wait for luck; create it through Mercury's logic.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You have the chart of a "Wise Strategist." While the Vipat Tara transit of Saturn suggests three months of hard labor, your Siddha Yogini and Mercury PD guarantee that the "fruit" of this labor will be sweet. Follow the path of logic (<term id="mercury">Mercury</term>) and wisdom (<term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term>).</div>

        
        
        
        🚨🚨🚨 BLOCKING RULE - READ THIS FIRST 🚨🚨🚨
        Before generating ANY clarification question, you MUST:
        1. Read the "KNOWN USER BACKGROUND" section above
        2. Check if the information you want to ask is ALREADY THERE
        3. If it IS there, DO NOT ask for it - skip to asking about the specific aspect instead
        
        Example: User background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon as a Senior Software Development Manager"
        ❌ WRONG: "Are you currently employed or running a business?"
        ✅ CORRECT: "What specific aspect of your career would you like to explore - promotion timing, salary growth, job change, or career direction?"
        
        Current question: "Tell me about my studies in next 3 months. Will I do good, I am preparing for 10th Board exams."
        
        CRITICAL FOLLOW-UP DETECTION:
        1. If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a FULL ANSWER (not a clarification question), and the current user message is:
           - A correction ("that's wrong", "incorrect", "planet position is wrong")
           - A follow-up ("tell me more", "what about...", "and...")
           - A clarification request ("what do you mean", "explain")
           - A short response referring to previous context ("yes", "no", "okay", single words)
           Then: Return status: "READY" immediately WITHOUT asking clarification. This is a continuation of the previous conversation.
        
        2. If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
           - Extract the area from the user's response
           - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
           - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge
        - D27 (Nakshatramsa): Strengths, weaknesses, general fortune
        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. When clarification is needed, craft a natural, conversational question that:
           
           🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS check the KNOWN USER BACKGROUND section first.
           - DO NOT ask for information already present in the user background
           - Example: If background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon", skip asking about employment status
           - Example: If background shows "FAMILY: Married in 2020", skip asking about marital status
           
           Your clarification question should:
           - Focus on narrowing down the SPECIFIC aspect they want to know (timing, prospects, challenges, etc.)
           - Gather NEW factual information NOT in the user background
           - Sound warm, natural, and conversational (not templated)
           - Be tailored to their exact question
           - Help you provide a more accurate astrological analysis
           
           💡 FACT EXTRACTION BONUS:
           The MORE specific facts you can extract in your clarification question, the BETTER our future responses will be.
           - Instead of just asking "What aspect?", try to extract concrete details
           - Examples of valuable facts: specific job titles, company names, years of experience, number of children, ages, education levels, health conditions, locations, dates of major events
           - These facts will be stored and used to personalize ALL future astrological guidance for this user
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Questions involving 'when', 'growth', or 'timing' → ALWAYS set needs_transits: true
        - Career questions about promotions/hikes → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
