Q: salary growth
A: What do the current transits mean for me?
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current planetary alignment is heavily focused on your finances. With the active **Saturn-Rahu** period activating your 2nd House (Wealth) and **Venus** strong in your 11th House (Gains), you are in a "Financial Hunger" phase where salary growth is not just possible, but highly probable. Specifically, expect a major compensation shift or successful negotiation between **April 2026 and July 2026**, as the <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term> shifts. However, your <term id="d9">D9</term> Mars indicates you must aggressively ask for what you are worth—passive hope will not work during this Rahu cycle.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Golden Goose" Placement:** Your <term id="venus">Venus</term> is in its own sign (Taurus) in the 11th House. This is a classic <term id="dhanyoga">Dhan Yoga</term> (Wealth Combination) ensuring that despite market fluctuations, your liquidity and salary potential remain fundamentally top-tier.
*   **The "Wealth Storm" Cluster:** You have a massive convergence of <term id="saturn">Saturn</term>, <term id="mars">Mars</term>, <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term>, and <term id="rahu">Rahu</term> all in your 2nd House (Accumulated Wealth). While this creates fluctuation, it promises massive sudden gains rather than slow incremental growth.
*   **The Jaimini Confirmation:** The current **Aquarius Period** (containing your Career Planet <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> Mercury) combined with the **Ulka (Saturn)** Yogini phase confirms that financial pressure now will break into financial success by mid-2026.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)**
Your financial foundation is exceptionally potent but volatile. The primary driver of your salary is **Venus in the 11th House (Taurus)**. In Vedic astrology, the 11th house represents "monthly paycheck" and "liquid gains." Having Venus here in its own sign is one of the strongest indicators for a high-income career.
However, the 2nd House (Savings/Family Wealth) in Leo contains a "Planetary War" zone: Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu.
*   **The Conflict:** Saturn (delay) limits the 2nd house, but Rahu (ambition) blows it up. This means your salary growth tends to come in "explosions" after periods of stagnation, rather than a steady 5% annual increase.

**2. The Master Clock (<term id="vimshottari">Vimshottari</term>)**
You are currently in the **Saturn <term id="mahadasha">Mahadasha</term> / Rahu <term id="antardasha">Antardasha</term>** (approx. 2025-2028).
*   **Analysis:** Both Saturn and Rahu sit in your 2nd House of Money.
*   **Prediction:** Rahu acts as a catalyst. It creates dissatisfaction with your current package and drives you to seek "foreign" or "unconventional" leverage to boost income. This is the best time in the 19-year Saturn cycle to pivot for a massive pay jump, likely involving a change in role or company structure.

**3. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Wealth)**
Your chart reveals specific <term id="nadi">Nadi</term> connections that define *how* your salary increases:

*   **The "Technical Wealth" Link (Saturn + Mars + Rahu):** Your Saturn (Career) is conjoined with Mars (Engineering/Strategy) and Rahu (Scale/Tech). This specific Nadi yoga indicates that your highest salary jumps come from **leading technical transformation, scaling infrastructure, or managing chaotic high-stakes projects**. You are paid to fix "expensive problems."
*   **The "Guru-Chandala" Money Link (Jupiter + Rahu):** Jupiter (Expansion) with Rahu in the money house suggests income through "disruptive wisdom"—consulting, specialized advising, or working with foreign/global entities.

**4. The Triple Perspective (<term id="sudarshana">Sudarshana</term>)**
*   **From Lagna (Body):** The 2nd House is crowded/heavy. Earning requires immense effort and overcoming obstacles (Saturn).
*   **From Moon (Mind):** Your Moon is in Libra. The 11th house from Moon is **Leo**, which contains that massive 4-planet wealth cluster.
*   **Verdict:** This is critical. While physically (Lagna) the work is hard, mentally and consequentially (Moon), this period is destined for **massive gains**. Since 2 out of 3 reference points highlight the Leo cluster as a source of gain, confidence in a salary hike is **High (85%)**.

**5. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
*   **Jaimini Chara Dasha:** You are currently in the **Aquarius** period (ends April 2026). Aquarius contains your **<term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (Mercury)**—the planet holding the key to your career status. Being in the sign of the Career Planet makes this the decisive time for professional value.
*   **Yogini Dasha:** You are running **Bhadrika (Mercury)** Mahadasha and **Ulka (Saturn)** Antardasha.
*   **Synthesis:** The convergence is striking. Chara Dasha highlights Mercury (Career) and Yogini highlights Mercury (Career) + Saturn (Wealth House).
*   **Prediction:** The transition out of the Aquarius Chara Dasha in **April 2026**, coinciding with the ongoing Saturn influence, marks the realization of this salary growth.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your 11th Lord Venus is in **Krittika** <term id="nakshatra">Nakshatra</term>. Krittika is ruled by the Sun and symbolized by a "Razor."
*   **Financial Implication:** Your salary growth requires "cutting" ties or making sharp, decisive demands. Krittika does not favor diplomatic negotiation; it favors proving competence and demanding the market rate. The Sun (ruler of Krittika) is in your 9th House, linking your salary directly to your "Authority" and "Expertise."

### Timing & Guidance
**Critical Window:** **April 2026 to July 2026**.
*   **Why:** The Chara Dasha moves to Capricorn, and the Yogini sub-period shifts.
*   **Action:** Prepare your case for a raise *now*. Use the Rahu energy (current Antardasha) to audit your market value. If your current employer cannot match the "Rahu-scale" jump you desire, this period strongly supports an external move for a 20-30% hike.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your chart is not designed for average salary growth; it is designed for "step-function" jumps. With Venus in the 11th and the active Saturn-Rahu dasha in the 2nd, you are in a prime window to reset your financial baseline. The key is to leverage the "Technical/Fixer" authority shown in your Nadi links to justify the premium.</div>

        Current question: "What do the current transits mean for me?"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge

        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2027

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},
            "mode": "annual" or "birth",
            "category": "category_name",

                }
            }
        }
