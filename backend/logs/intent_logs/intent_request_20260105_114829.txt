        You are a clarification assistant for an astrology chatbot. Your job is to determine if a question is too vague and needs clarification.
        

Previous conversation:
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: employed, career direction
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **Saturn-Rahu** period (until Nov 2026) is creating a "pressure cooker" effect where high ambition meets intense workload and mental stress. **Specifically, expect a decisive positive shift in your career status between April 2026 (Chara Dasha move to Capricorn) and November 2026 (start of Saturn-Jupiter).** Your inner chart (D10) reveals an Exalted Mercury, confirming that your true success lies in specialized analysis, technical management, or advisory roles rather than general administration. **Action:** Use the next 6 months to upskill in technical or data-driven fields; the planetary war in your wealth house demands you secure your niche now for the rewards coming in late 2026.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "War Zone" of Wealth:** Your 2nd House (Leo) contains a massive conjunction of Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu. This creates a <term id="key">Dharma-Karmadhipati Yoga</term> (Career + Luck), meaning your career is directly tied to accumulating wealth, but it comes with constant friction and competition.
*   **The Hidden Superpower (D10):** While your main chart shows struggle, your **D10 Dasamsa** (Career Chart) features **Mercury Exalted in the 10th House**. This is a "Executive Intelligence" placement. You are designed for roles requiring sharp intellect, communication, and complex problem-solving.
*   **The Jaimini Confirmation:** The current **Aquarius Chara Dasha** (active until April 2026) holds your <term id="key">Amatyakaraka</term> (Career Planet) Mercury. This confirms that the current stress is actually "polishing" your professional skills for the next phase.
*   **Timing Verdict:** The immediate window (Ulka Yogini + Rahu Antardasha) is volatile. Stability returns post-November 2026.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)**
Your 10th Lord (Mars) is placed in the 2nd House of income, sitting with Jupiter (9th Lord). This forms a powerful **Dharma-Karmadhipati Yoga**, ensuring that your work will always generate resources. However, the presence of Saturn (delay) and Rahu (ambition) in the same sign creates a "Stop-Go" pattern. You likely experience periods of stagnation followed by sudden, explosive growth.

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari)**
*   **Current Period: Saturn-Rahu (Ending Nov 2026):** Saturn is your 7th/8th Lord and Rahu creates illusion. This period typically brings "Golden Handcuffs"—high responsibility, potential for foreign connections or tech work, but high anxiety. Rahu in Leo amplifies the desire for authority.
*   **Upcoming Period: Saturn-Jupiter (Nov 2026 - May 2029):** This is the "Harvest." Jupiter is your 9th Lord of Fortune sitting in the wealth house. The intense work you are doing now will pay off here.

**3. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
*   **Chara Dasha Trigger:** You are currently in the **Aquarius** period (until April 2026). Aquarius houses your <term id="key">Amatyakaraka</term> (Mercury), making this a career-defining era. In April 2026, you shift into **Capricorn**, which activates your 7th house of public image and partnerships.
*   **Yogini Dasha Confirmation:** You are currently under **Bhadrika (Mercury)** Mahadasha, which supports career growth through intellect. However, the current sub-period is **Ulka (Saturn)** (Sept 2025 - July 2026). In Yogini, Ulka represents labor and upheaval.
*   **Synthesis:** The **Aquarius** Chara Dasha combined with **Ulka** Yogini confirms that early 2026 is a time of transformation and hard work, clearing the path for the stability promised by the upcoming Saturn-Jupiter Vimshottari period.

**4. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your work:
*   **The "Technical Master" Link (Saturn + Mars):** Your Karma Karaka (Saturn) is conjoined with Mars. This specifically indicates a career involving engineering, technical machinery, logic, coding, or rigorous project management. You are not meant for "soft" HR roles; you need technical complexity.
*   **The "Shadow Tech" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** This connection suggests success in modern fields like AI, large-scale infrastructure, foreign MNCs, or unconventional industries. It often brings success away from your birthplace.
*   **The "Advisory" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** This modifies the hardness of Mars/Rahu, giving you the capacity to teach, advise, or manage teams in these technical fields.

**5. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **10th from Lagna (Cancer):** Aries (Ruled by Mars) – Indicates an aggressive, enterprising approach to career.
*   **10th from Moon (Libra):** Cancer (Ruled by Moon) – Indicates a need for emotional connection or public service in your work.
*   **10th from Sun (Pisces):** Sagittarius (Ruled by Jupiter) – Indicates an eventual rise to a position of wisdom and advisory authority.
*   **Verdict:** Since 3 out of 3 perspectives point to Mars/Jupiter ruled signs (Aries/Sagittarius) or their lords, your career **must** involve the combination of **Technical Action (Mars)** and **Strategic Wisdom (Jupiter)**. A pure management role without technical grounding will bore you; a pure coding role without strategy will frustrate you.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your **10th House Cusp** falls in **Ashwini** (ruled by Ketu). This suggests your career path may have started suddenly or involves quick turnarounds, healing, or "fixing" broken systems.
Your **Saturn (Career Lord)** is in **Uttara Phalguni** (ruled by the Sun). This is the star of "Patronage." It indicates that your ultimate career stability comes from a connection to the government, C-suite leadership, or establishing your own authority, rather than remaining a subordinate forever.

### Timing & Guidance
*   **Immediate (Now - April 2026):** Hold steady. The **Ulka** Yogini influence creates workplace politics or sudden changes. Do not resign impulsively.
*   **The Shift (April 2026 - Nov 2026):** The Chara Dasha shift to Capricorn puts the focus on partnerships. This is the best time to negotiate contracts or switch teams.
*   **The Peak (Nov 2026 onwards):** Saturn-Jupiter begins. This is your promotion window.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your chart is not a "smooth sailing" chart; it is a "high achievement through friction" chart. The heavy concentration of planets in your 2nd house means your career is the primary engine of your life's wealth. The stress you feel now (Saturn-Rahu) is the final exam before you graduate to the "Advisor/Leader" phase (Saturn-Jupiter) in late 2026. Trust your technical expertise (D10 Mercury); it is your greatest asset.</div>

        
        Current question: "employed, career direction"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge

        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},
            "mode": "annual" or "birth",
            "category": "category_name",
            "year": SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION (only for annual mode),
            "needs_transits": true or false,

            "transit_request": {
                "startYear": SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION,
                "endYear": SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION,
                "yearMonthMap": {
                    "SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION": ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
                }
            }
        }
