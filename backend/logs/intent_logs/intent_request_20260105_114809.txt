Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **Saturn-Rahu** period (until Nov 2026) is creating a "pressure cooker" effect where high ambition meets intense workload and mental stress. **Specifically, expect a decisive positive shift in your career status between April 2026 (Chara Dasha move to Capricorn) and November 2026 (start of Saturn-Jupiter).** Your inner chart (D10) reveals an Exalted Mercury, confirming that your true success lies in specialized analysis, technical management, or advisory roles rather than general administration. **Action:** Use the next 6 months to upskill in technical or data-driven fields; the planetary war in your wealth house demands you secure your niche now for the rewards coming in late 2026.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "War Zone" of Wealth:** Your 2nd House (Leo) contains a massive conjunction of Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu. This creates a <term id="key">Dharma-Karmadhipati Yoga</term> (Career + Luck), meaning your career is directly tied to accumulating wealth, but it comes with constant friction and competition.
*   **The Hidden Superpower (D10):** While your main chart shows struggle, your **D10 Dasamsa** (Career Chart) features **Mercury Exalted in the 10th House**. This is a "Executive Intelligence" placement. You are designed for roles requiring sharp intellect, communication, and complex problem-solving.
*   **The Jaimini Confirmation:** The current **Aquarius Chara Dasha** (active until April 2026) holds your <term id="key">Amatyakaraka</term> (Career Planet) Mercury. This confirms that the current stress is actually "polishing" your professional skills for the next phase.
*   **Timing Verdict:** The immediate window (Ulka Yogini + Rahu Antardasha) is volatile. Stability returns post-November 2026.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)**
Your 10th Lord (Mars) is placed in the 2nd House of income, sitting with Jupiter (9th Lord). This forms a powerful **Dharma-Karmadhipati Yoga**, ensuring that your work will always generate resources. However, the presence of Saturn (delay) and Rahu (ambition) in the same sign creates a "Stop-Go" pattern. You likely experience periods of stagnation followed by sudden, explosive growth.

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari)**
*   **Current Period: Saturn-Rahu (Ending Nov 2026):** Saturn is your 7th/8th Lord and Rahu creates illusion. This period typically brings "Golden Handcuffs"—high responsibility, potential for foreign connections or tech work, but high anxiety. Rahu in Leo amplifies the desire for authority.
*   **Upcoming Period: Saturn-Jupiter (Nov 2026 - May 2029):** This is the "Harvest." Jupiter is your 9th Lord of Fortune sitting in the wealth house. The intense work you are doing now will pay off here.

**3. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
*   **Chara Dasha Trigger:** You are currently in the **Aquarius** period (until April 2026). Aquarius houses your <term id="key">Amatyakaraka</term> (Mercury), making this a career-defining era. In April 2026, you shift into **Capricorn**, which activates your 7th house of public image and partnerships.
*   **Yogini Dasha Confirmation:** You are currently under **Bhadrika (Mercury)** Mahadasha, which supports career growth through intellect. However, the current sub-period is **Ulka (Saturn)** (Sept 2025 - July 2026). In Yogini, Ulka represents labor and upheaval.
*   **Synthesis:** The **Aquarius** Chara Dasha combined with **Ulka** Yogini confirms that early 2026 is a time of transformation and hard work, clearing the path for the stability promised by the upcoming Saturn-Jupiter Vimshottari period.

**4. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your work:
*   **The "Technical Master" Link (Saturn + Mars):** Your Karma Karaka (Saturn) is conjoined with Mars. This specifically indicates a career involving engineering, technical machinery, logic, coding, or rigorous project management. You are not meant for "soft" HR roles; you need technical complexity.
*   **The "Shadow Tech" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** This connection suggests success in modern fields like AI, large-scale infrastructure, foreign MNCs, or unconventional industries. It often brings success away from your birthplace.
*   **The "Advisory" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** This modifies the hardness of Mars/Rahu, giving you the capacity to teach, advise, or manage teams in these technical fields.

**5. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **10th from Lagna (Cancer):** Aries (Ruled by Mars) – Indicates an aggressive, enterprising approach to career.
*   **10th from Moon (Libra):** Cancer (Ruled by Moon) – Indicates a need for emotional connection or public service in your work.
*   **10th from Sun (Pisces):** Sagittarius (Ruled by Jupiter) – Indicates an eventual rise to a position of wisdom and advisory authority.
*   **Verdict:** Since 3 out of 3 perspectives point to Mars/Jupiter ruled signs (Aries/Sagittarius) or their lords, your career **must** involve the combination of **Technical Action (Mars)** and **Strategic Wisdom (Jupiter)**. A pure management role without technical grounding will bore you; a pure coding role without strategy will frustrate you.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your **10th House Cusp** falls in **Ashwini** (ruled by Ketu). This suggests your career path may have started suddenly or involves quick turnarounds, healing, or "fixing" broken systems.
Your **Saturn (Career Lord)** is in **Uttara Phalguni** (ruled by the Sun). This is the star of "Patronage." It indicates that your ultimate career stability comes from a connection to the government, C-suite leadership, or establishing your own authority, rather than remaining a subordinate forever.

### Timing & Guidance
*   **Immediate (Now - April 2026):** Hold steady. The **Ulka** Yogini influence creates workplace politics or sudden changes. Do not resign impulsively.
*   **The Shift (April 2026 - Nov 2026):** The Chara Dasha shift to Capricorn puts the focus on partnerships. This is the best time to negotiate contracts or switch teams.
*   **The Peak (Nov 2026 onwards):** Saturn-Jupiter begins. This is your promotion window.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your chart is not a "smooth sailing" chart; it is a "high achievement through friction" chart. The heavy concentration of planets in your 2nd house means your career is the primary engine of your life's wealth. The stress you feel now (Saturn-Rahu) is the final exam before you graduate to the "Advisor/Leader" phase (Saturn-Jupiter) in late 2026. Trust your technical expertise (D10 Mercury); it is your greatest asset.</div>
Q: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **Saturn-Rahu** period creates a "pressure cooker" environment where high ambition meets intense workload. **Specifically, expect a significant positive shift in your role or authority between April 2026 (Chara Dasha shift) and November 2026 (Jupiter sub-period start).** Your inner chart (D9/D10) confirms you are moving from a "worker" phase into a "strategic advisor" phase. **Action:** Focus on showcasing your analytical/specialized skills now to secure that leadership transition by late 2026.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Leo Cluster" Power:** You have a massive concentration of energy (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Rahu) in your 2nd House of Wealth/Speech in Leo. This indicates a career driven by **Technical Leadership, Management, and Resource Administration**.
*   **The "Analytic Genius" (D10):** In your Career Chart (D10), <term id="key">Mercury</term> is **Exalted in the 10th House**. This is the strongest possible placement for professionals in data, engineering, finance, or specialized consultancy. You are built to solve complex problems.
*   **The Jaimini Confirmation:** The current **Aquarius Chara Dasha** (active until April 2026) contains your <term id="key">Amatyakaraka</term> (Career Planet) Mercury. This confirms that despite stress, this is a peak period for professional visibility.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)**
Your chart is defined by the **Leo Stellium** in the 2nd House. The 10th Lord (Mars) sits with the 9th Lord (Jupiter) and the Taskmaster (Saturn). This creates a <term id="key">Dharma-Karma Adhipati Yoga</term>, but heavily modified by Rahu.
*   **What it means:** You are not meant to be a subordinate forever. Your career path leads to high-level management where you control resources or finances. The connection to the 2nd house suggests your voice or advice is your product.

<div class="image-placeholder" data-image-id="mercury_exalted" data-description="Mercury exalted in D10 indicates high analytical intelligence">🖼️ Mercury exalted in D10 indicates high analytical intelligence</div>

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)**
You are currently in **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha** (until Nov 2026).
*   **The Vibe:** Saturn requires discipline; Rahu demands expansion. This creates an internal conflict: "Should I play it safe or take a risk?"
*   **The Outcome:** Rahu in Leo (with the 10th lord Mars) creates an ambition for status. You are likely feeling undervalued or pushing hard for a title change. This struggle resolves in **November 2026**, when **Saturn-Jupiter** begins—a classic period for "Promotions through Wisdom/Advisory."

**3. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your work:

*   **The "Technical Commander" Link (Saturn + Mars):** Saturn (Career) is conjoined Mars (Technology/Engineering). This confirms your success comes from **technical management, machinery, operations, or engineering logic**, not soft skills or HR.
*   **The "Advisory" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** Saturn is also conjoined Jupiter. This modifies the "Technical" nature into "Consultancy." You are the expert others come to for the "Big Picture" solution.
*   **The "Expansion" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** This indicates involvement with large-scale organizations, foreign technology, or "Shadow" industries (like backend tech, AI, or cyber-infrastructure).

**4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **10th from Lagna (Cancer):** Aries (ruled by Mars in Leo) – Career requires aggression, initiative, and leadership.
*   **10th from Moon (Libra):** Cancer (ruled by Moon) – Career involves public dealing or understanding human needs.
*   **10th from Sun (Pisces):** Sagittarius (ruled by Jupiter) – Career culminates in teaching, guiding, or policy-making.
*   **Verdict:** Since Mars and Jupiter dominate the triple view (2 out of 3), the confidence level is **85%** that your ultimate role is a **Technical Director or Strategic Consultant**.

**5. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
*   **Jaimini Chara Dasha:** You are currently in the **Aquarius** period (containing your Career Planet, Mercury). In **April 2026**, you shift into **Capricorn**, which aspects your Leo Stellium (activating the Raj Yoga of Saturn/Mars/Jupiter). This double-confirms 2026 as a pivot year.
*   **Yogini Dasha:** You are currently under **Bhadrika (Mercury)** Mahadasha and **Ulka (Saturn)** Antardasha.
    *   *Conflict Analysis:* While Vimshottari (Saturn-Rahu) feels chaotic, Yogini (Mercury-Saturn) is highly productive because Mercury is Exalted in your D10. The stress you feel is "growing pains," not failure.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your 10th Lord Mars is in **Magha Nakshatra** (The Royal Throne).
*   **Symbolism:** The Palanquin.
*   **Meaning:** You crave authority and legacy. Working in a "back office" role without recognition will drain your soul. Magha demands that you be the "King" of your specific domain.
*   **Advice:** Seek roles where you have autonomy. Magha struggles with micromanagement.

### Timing & Guidance
*   **Current - April 2026:** High workload. Focus on mastering the technical details (Mercury focus). Do not quit impulsively due to Rahu's restlessness.
*   **April 2026 - Nov 2026:** The shift happens. The Chara Dasha change to Capricorn activates your leadership sector. Negotiate for a higher position.
*   **Nov 2026 onwards (Saturn-Jupiter):** The "Golden Period" of this Dasha cycle. Stability returns, and you step into a mentorship/senior role.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are currently in the "pressure test" phase of your career (Saturn-Rahu). Your D10 chart (Exalted Mercury) guarantees you have the skill to pass this test. The frustration you feel is simply the gap between your ambition (Rahu) and the current reality (Saturn). Bridge this gap by specializing deeply now; the title and authority (Magha) will naturally follow in late 2026.</div>

        Current question: "What does my birth chart say about my career?"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge

        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},

            "category": "category_name",

                    "SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION": ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
                }
            }
