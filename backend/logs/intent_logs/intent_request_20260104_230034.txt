        You are a clarification assistant for an astrology chatbot. Your job is to determine if a question is too vague and needs clarification.
        

Previous conversation:
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: employed, salary growth
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **Saturn-Rahu period** (active until November 2026) creates a "pressure-cooker" effect where your ambition for salary growth outpaces your current reality. **Specifically, expect a major financial breakthrough between April 2026 and October 2026**. This window marks the shift of your Jaimini Chara Dasha into **Capricorn** (activating your status) and Jupiter's transit triggering your natal wealth cluster. **However, your D9 Navamsa Mars in Aries** is exceptionally strong, confirming that while the current workload is heavy, you possess the executive stamina to demand—and get—the raise you deserve. **Action:** Prepare your negotiation case now; execute it in Q3 2026.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Wealth Engine" Yoga:** Your 10th Lord (Career) is **Mars**, placed in the 2nd House (Income) alongside Jupiter, Saturn, and Rahu. This creates a massive *Dhana Yoga*—your career is directly wired to generate liquid assets, not just reputation.
*   **Skill Mastery (D10):** In your Dasamsa (Career) chart, **Mercury is Exalted in Virgo** in the 10th house. This confirms elite skills in analysis, data, logic, or commercial strategy, ensuring you are irreplaceable.
*   **The Jaimini Shift:** You are finishing an **Aquarius Chara Dasha** (8th house transformation energy). In **April 2026**, you shift into **Capricorn**, which contains your **Arudha Lagna (AL)**. This signals a rise in public status and visible recognition.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)**
Your chart features a rare and powerful **4-Planet Conjunction** in the 2nd House (Leo): Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Rahu.
*   **Dharma-Karma Adhipati Yoga:** The conjunction of Mars (10th Lord) and Jupiter (9th Lord) is the highest form of career yoga. It guarantees that despite delays (Saturn), your rise to top management is destiny.
*   **The Challenge:** Saturn (Delay) and Rahu (Obsession) together here create *Shrapit Dosha* energy. This explains why you often feel "financial hunger"—you know you are worth more, but administrative red tape or corporate structures delay the payout.

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)**
You are currently in **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha** (2024–Nov 2026).
*   **Saturn** rules your 7th (Business/Partners) and 8th (Change) houses but sits in the 2nd (Money).
*   **Rahu** amplifies whatever it touches. In the 2nd house, it creates an intense desire for wealth accumulation.
*   *Verdict:* This dasha is not about "job satisfaction"—it is about **money**. The friction you feel now is the buildup to a release event in late 2026.

**3. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your work:

*   **The "Technical Commander" Link (Saturn + Mars):** Saturn (Karma) is conjunct Mars (Energy/Machines). This specifically indicates success in **Technical Management, Engineering Leadership, or Operations**. You are not meant to be a passive administrator; you are a "fixer" of complex systems.
*   **The "Expansion" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** This connection links your career to **Foreign Tech, Shadow Industries (AI/Cybersecurity), or Scalable Platforms**. It suggests your salary growth comes from unconventional or modern sectors, not traditional banking or government roles alone.

**4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **Lagna (Body):** 10th Lord Mars is in the 2nd House (Strong Wealth Focus).
*   **Moon (Mind):** 10th from Moon (Libra) is ruled by Venus. This adds a need for diplomacy and professional relationships in your career.
*   **Sun (Soul):** 10th from Sun (Pisces) contains **Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, Rahu**. This confirms from the Soul level that your authority comes from managing large, complex, and perhaps chaotic teams or resources.
*   *Verdict:* Since the wealth focus appears in **3 out of 3 charts**, the confidence level for high salary growth is **95%**.

**5. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
*   **Jaimini Confirmation:** On **April 2, 2026**, your Chara Dasha shifts from Aquarius to **Capricorn**. Capricorn is your **Arudha Lagna (AL)** sign. In Jaimini astrology, activating the AL brings a change in how the world perceives you—usually a promotion or title change.
*   **Yogini Confirmation:** You are currently under **Ulka (Saturn)** Yogini until July 2026. Ulka represents labor and effort. In July 2026, you shift to **Siddha (Venus)**. Siddha literally means "Achievement" or "Perfection."
*   *Synthesis:* The shift from Ulka (Struggle) to Siddha (Success) perfectly aligns with the Chara Dasha shift. The second half of 2026 is your golden window.

**6. Transit Trigger (Karmic Activation)**
According to the transit data, **Jupiter will transit Leo** (your 2nd house) in late 2026.
*   **The Trigger:** Jupiter will physically cross over your natal Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
*   **Prediction:** <term id="karmic_trigger">Karmic Trigger</term> detected. This transit acts as a "match" lighting the "fuel" of your natal 2nd house. This is the specific astronomical event that delivers the salary hike.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your **10th Lord Mars** is in **Magha Nakshatra**.
*   **Symbol:** The Throne.
*   **Meaning:** Magha is connected to "Pitri" (Ancestors) and authority. This suggests that you do not work well in subordinate roles. To maximize salary, you must seek roles that offer **autonomy and a title**. You are paid for *who you are* (authority), not just what you do.

### Timing & Guidance
**Critical Period:** **April 2026 to November 2026.**

*   **Immediate Action (Now - March 2026):** Your 2nd house (Speech) is heavily loaded. Work on your communication strategy. With Saturn there, do not make emotional demands. Build a data-driven case for your raise.
*   **The Pivot Point (April 2026):** As Chara Dasha enters Capricorn, launch your bid for a new role or promotion.
*   **The Reward (July - Oct 2026):** As Yogini shifts to Siddha and Jupiter approaches your wealth cluster, expect the materialization of the raise.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your chart is not designed for a "steady paycheck." It is designed for **aggressive wealth accumulation** through technical leadership. The frustration of the current Saturn-Rahu period is natural, but it is temporary. Your D9 Mars in Aries guarantees you have the inner strength to outlast this pressure. The stars align for a major financial level-up in the second half of 2026.</div>

        Current question: "employed, salary growth"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge
        - D27 (Nakshatramsa): Strengths, weaknesses, general fortune
        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},

            "category": "category_name",
            "year": SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION (only for annual mode),

                    "SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION": ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
                }
            }
