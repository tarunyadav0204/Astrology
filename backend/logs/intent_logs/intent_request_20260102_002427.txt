        You are a clarification assistant for an astrology chatbot. Your job is to determine if a question is too vague and needs clarification.
        

Previous conversation:
Q: What are my health vulnerabilities?
A: general overview
Q: employed looking for salary growth
A: I can help you with that! What specific health concerns do you have, or are you looking for a general overview of your health vulnerabilities based on your birth chart?
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **Saturn-Rahu** period (until mid-2027) creates a powerful "Ambition Spike," making this the ideal time to aggressively pursue salary growth. Specifically, expect a significant financial breakthrough or role change between **January and April 2026**, as your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (Career Planet) is activated by the closing months of your current time cycle. However, your **D9 Navamsa** shows Saturn and Sun in the 10th house, indicating that this wealth comes with increased responsibility—you must accept a "heavier crown" to get the raise. **Action:** Leverage your technical or specialized expertise immediately; the planetary alignment favors a job switch or "ultimatum-style" negotiation right now.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Money-Career" Fusion:** Your 10th Lord (Career) is **Mars**, sitting directly in your 2nd House (Wealth) with Jupiter, Saturn, and Rahu. This is a massive <term id="dhanayoga">Dhana Yoga</term>, meaning your career is destined to be a major source of accumulated wealth, not just a paycheck.
*   **Uncapped Income Potential:** Your 11th Lord **Venus** is strong in its Own Sign (Taurus) in the 11th House. This is one of the best placements for liquid gains and bonuses, suggesting that salary caps don't apply to you if you negotiate performance-based pay.
*   **The Hidden "Superpower":** While your main chart shows intensity, your **D10 Dasamsa** (Career Chart) features **Mercury Exalted in the 10th House**. This confirms elite professional skills—you are likely overqualified for your current pay grade, which is the root of your desire for growth.
*   **Jaimini Confirmation:** The current <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term> of **Aquarius** (active until April 2026) contains your **Amatyakaraka** (Mercury), signaling a peak career milestone is happening *right now*.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)**
Your chart is engineered for high earnings. The concentration of four planets—**Mars (10th Lord), Jupiter (9th Lord), Saturn, and Rahu**—in the 2nd House (Leo) creates a high-voltage financial engine.
*   **Dharma-Karma Adhipati Yoga:** The conjunction of Mars (10th Lord) and Jupiter (9th Lord) is a Raj Yoga indicating high status.
*   **The Rahu Factor:** Rahu in the 2nd house with these planets creates an insatiable hunger for wealth. In the context of salary growth, this is positive—it gives you the audacity to ask for what you're worth.

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)**
You are currently in the **Saturn Mahadasha, Rahu Antardasha** (2025–2027).
*   **Saturn** rules your 7th and 8th houses but sits in the 2nd (Wealth).
*   **Rahu** sits in the 2nd house (Wealth) and acts like the planets it conjoins (Mars/Jupiter).
*   **Analysis:** This is the specific "Material Manifestation" period of your 19-year Saturn cycle. Rahu breaks boundaries, often bringing sudden jumps in income through "foreign" sources, tech, or unconventional roles. This period supports job-hopping for a 20-30% hike rather than waiting for a standard appraisal.

**3. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career/Wealth)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define *why* you get paid:
*   **The "Tech-Master" Link (Saturn + Mars):** This combination indicates success comes from **technical management, engineering, or specialized execution**. You are paid for handling "hard" problems, not just administration.
*   **The "MNC/Shadow" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** This specifically connects your career to **foreign companies, large corporations, or cutting-edge tech (AI/Data)**. The salary growth you seek is likely found in global organizations or "disruptive" sectors.
*   **The "Dharma" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** This adds an advisory or mentorship layer. You earn more when you position yourself as a "Subject Matter Expert" rather than just a worker.

**4. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
*   **Chara Dasha Confirmation:** You are in the final phase of the **Aquarius** period (ends April 2026). Aquarius contains your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (Mercury), which is the primary significator of career status. The presence of the Career Planet in the active Sign Dasha is a "Double Confirmation" that professional elevation is due.
*   **Yogini Confirmation:** You are running **Bhadrika (Mercury)** Mahadasha and **Ulka (Saturn)** Antardasha. While Ulka signifies "workload/stress," it is subservient to Mercury (your exalted D10 planet). This confirms that the salary hike (Mercury) comes through taking on a difficult or high-pressure project (Saturn).

**5. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **Lagna (Body):** 10th Lord Mars is in the 2nd House (Wealth) → **Excellent**.
*   **Moon (Mind):** 10th House from Moon (Cancer) is your Lagna. This shows your career defines your identity.
*   **Sun (Soul):** 10th House from Sun (Pisces) is Sagittarius, containing the Sun and Saturn in the D9 chart. This indicates authority.
*   **Verdict:** Since this wealth focus appears in **3 out of 3** perspectives, the confidence level is **95%**—financial growth is structurally guaranteed, provided you navigate the Saturn-Rahu intensity.

**6. The "Secret Weapon" (D10 Dasamsa)**
In your D10 Career Chart, **Mercury is Exalted in Virgo in the 10th House**. This is the highest possible dignity for a career planet. It means your "professional output" is flawless. If your current employer doesn't recognize this value (due to D1 obstacles), the market *will*. This placement specifically favors analytics, commerce, and specialized skills.

### Practical Guidance
1.  **Immediate Window (Now - April 2026):** The Aquarius Chara Dasha is finishing. This is a "closing" energy often associated with cashing out or finalizing a deal. Push for the raise **now**.
2.  **The "Rahu" Strategy:** Since you are in Rahu Antardasha, "loyalty" will not pay. Rahu rewards movement. Interview outside your current company to establish your market rate.
3.  **Negotiation Angle:** Use your "Saturn-Mars" strength. Don't ask for a raise based on tenure (Saturn); ask based on your ability to solve technical/critical problems (Mars) that others can't.
4.  **Remedy:** The 2nd House congestion (Saturn/Mars/Rahu) can cause harsh speech during negotiations. On Tuesdays, feed birds or stray animals to pacify the aggressive energy of Mars/Rahu, ensuring your "ask" comes across as confident, not arrogant.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are professionally "under-priced" relative to your D10 strength. The stars (Saturn-Rahu) are practically shouting at you to correct this market inefficiency. The period until **April 2026** is your prime window to lock in a new rate. Be bold—your chart supports the ambition.</div>

        
        Current question: "general overview"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge
        - D27 (Nakshatramsa): Strengths, weaknesses, general fortune
        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",

                }
            }
        }
