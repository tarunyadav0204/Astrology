Q: relationships
A: What events do you find for me in January 2026?
Q: What do the current transits mean for me?
A: Based on your birth chart and the upcoming planetary shift, here is the analysis of your relationship prospects.

<div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: You are currently in a highly karmic "clearing" phase for relationships, driven by the intense **Saturn-Rahu** period. While the current time (late 2025) may feel volatile or emotionally heavy due to the <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term> of Aquarius (8th House), a massive positive shift occurs in **April 2026**. This is when your Chara Dasha moves into **Capricorn (your 7th House of Marriage)**, marking a definitive 2-year window for serious partnership or stabilizing an existing union. However, with your 7th Lord **Saturn** heavily influenced by **Mars**, you must guard against letting ego or harsh speech disrupt your harmony.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The Partnership-Family Link:** Your 7th Lord (<term id="saturn">Saturn</term>) is placed in the 2nd House (Family/Wealth), indicating that your relationships are deeply tied to financial stability and family acceptance.
*   **The "Volcanic" 2nd House:** You have a massive conjunction of **Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu** in your 2nd House. This creates high energy in relationships—passionate, but prone to sudden conflicts (Mars) or misunderstandings (Rahu).
*   **The 2026 Turning Point:** The Jaimini Chara Dasha confirms that **April 2026** is the "Gatekeeper" moment where the focus shifts from internal struggle (Aquarius) to external partnership success (Capricorn).

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Relationship Potential)**
Your **7th House** (Partnership) is Capricorn, ruled by **Saturn**. Saturn is placed in the 2nd House (Leo), which creates a <term id="dhanyoga">Dhan Yoga</term> through marriage—meaning partners bring financial structure. However, Saturn is conjoined with **Mars** and **Rahu**.
*   **The Challenge:** This combination creates a "Mangal Dosha" influence, where impulsive speech (2nd house) can damage long-term bonds (Saturn).
*   **The Protection:** **Venus**, the planet of love, is strong in its Own Sign of Taurus in the **11th House** (Gains). This is a fantastic placement, promising that despite struggles, your desires and social circle will ultimately support your love life.

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)**
You are currently running **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha** (June 2025 – April 2028).
*   **Saturn** is your 7th Lord (Spouse).
*   **Rahu** acts as a catalyst, amplifying whatever it touches. Since Rahu sits with Saturn in your chart, this entire period is dedicated to **relationship karma**.
*   **Prediction:** Rahu brings the "unconventional." You may meet someone from a different culture, background, or through sudden, unexpected circumstances. If you are already married, this period demands "reinventing" the relationship to avoid stagnation.

**3. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
The timing for relationship events is double-confirmed by the Jaimini system:
*   **Chara Dasha Confirmation:** You are currently finishing the **Aquarius** period (8th House of obstacles). On **April 2, 2026**, you enter the **Capricorn** period. Capricorn is your **7th House**—the house of marriage itself. This synchronization with the Saturn-Rahu Vimshottari period guarantees a major relationship event between **April 2026 and mid-2027**.
*   **Yogini Dasha Confirmation:** You are currently under **Bhadrika (Mercury)** followed by **Ulka (Saturn)** starting September 2025. Since Saturn is your 7th Lord, the **Ulka** period (Sept 2025 – July 2026) will trigger the necessary changes to prepare you for the 2026 peak.

**4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **From Lagna (Cancer):** 7th House is Capricorn (Stability).
*   **From Moon (Libra):** 7th House is Aries, containing Mars and Mercury. This adds a layer of intellectual connection but also potential arguments (Mars).
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** 7th House is Virgo.
*   **Verdict:** Since 2 out of 3 reference points (Lagna and Moon) link relationship lords to **Mars/Saturn** energy, the confidence level is **85%** that relationships will require disciplined effort and patience rather than just being "easy romance."

**5. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Love)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the *quality* of your relationships:
*   **The "Venus + Gulika" Link:** Venus (Love) is conjoined <term id="gulika">Gulika</term> in your chart. This is a crucial Nadi indicator that warns against "toxic attachments." It suggests that you may attract partners who have emotional baggage or that relationships can start with a period of confusion before clarifying.
*   **The "Venus + Mars" Link (Trinal):** Although not in the same sign, the fire energy connects. This indicates a passionate dynamic where "making up" often happens through grand gestures or physical connection.

**6. Navamsa (D9) - The Soul of Marriage**
In the <term id="d9">D9 Navamsa</term> chart, **Venus** is in Aquarius (12th House). This placement is fascinating—it suggests that your deepest relationship happiness comes from **privacy** and **spiritual connection**. You likely crave a partner with whom you can retreat from the world. A public or overly social relationship may drain you; a private, secluded bond will rejuvenate you.

### Practical Guidance

1.  **The "Speech" Remedy:** Since the main affliction is in your 2nd House (Speech/Family), strictly avoid harsh words during arguments. The Saturn-Mars conjunction makes words hurt like weapons. When angry, take a 10-minute pause before speaking.
2.  **April 2026 Preparation:** The period between now and April 2026 is for "clearing the deck." Resolve old relationship issues or finish closing past chapters so you are ready for the Capricorn activation.
3.  **Spiritual Protection:** Given the Venus-Gulika link, ensure you maintain your own energetic boundaries. Do not try to "save" a partner; look for an equal.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are walking through a karmic tunnel (Aquarius period) that opens up into a garden (Capricorn period) in **April 2026**. Use this current time to work on emotional stability and family harmony. The planets promise a significant partnership, but it demands maturity and patience to sustain.</div>

Q: salary growth
A: I can help with that! Which area of your life are you most curious about in relation to the current transits? For example, career, relationships, finances, health, or something else?

        
        Current question: "What events do you find for me in January 2026?"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge
        - D27 (Nakshatramsa): Strengths, weaknesses, general fortune
        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2027

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},

            "category": "category_name",
            "year": SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION (only for annual mode),

                    "SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION": ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
                }
            }
        }
