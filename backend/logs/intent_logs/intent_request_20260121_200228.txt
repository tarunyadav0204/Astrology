Previous conversation:
Q: I already said health
A: What are my health vulnerabilities?
Q: General overview
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your chart shows a specific vulnerability in the **Leo-Aquarius axis** (2nd and 8th houses), currently activated by your **Saturn-Rahu** period. With your Ascendant in the sensitive **Gandanta** zone (Ashlesha-Magha junction) and **Rahu transiting your 8th house** (which has low Ashtakavarga strength), the focus is on **sudden, hard-to-diagnose issues** related to the **throat, digestion, or nervous system**. However, Jupiter's transit in your 12th house (with very high strength) promises excellent recovery and medical support if needed.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The Gandanta Factor**: Your Ascendant is at **29.88° Cancer**, placing your physical body in a "Karmic Knot" (Gandanta). This indicates high physical sensitivity during stress and potential issues with fluid retention or the lymphatic system.
• **The Leo Cluster**: Your 2nd House (Leo) contains a massive planetary conjunction (Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, Rahu). This concentrates stress on **Leo body parts**: the heart, upper spine, and stomach.
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your current **Aquarius Chara Dasha** (2020–2026) directly activates your **8th House** of chronic health and transformation, doubling the need for preventative care.

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View (The Leo Overload)
Your chart features a rare and intense 4-planet conjunction in the **2nd House (Leo)** involving Saturn (8th Lord of longevity), Jupiter (6th Lord of health), Mars (energy), and Rahu (amplification).
*   **The 6th Lord in the 2nd**: Jupiter (Health Lord) sitting with Saturn (Chronic Lord) suggests health issues may stem from **dietary habits** or **metabolic sluggishness**.
*   **Saturn's Grip**: As your Ascendant Lord (Moon) is aspected by Saturn (-7 score), your vitality relies heavily on disciplined routines. Saturn in Leo typically restricts the flow of vitality, pointing to potential stiffness, dental issues, or acidity.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive (Relative Analysis)
From the perspective of your current **Aquarius Chara Dasha** (2020–2026):
*   **Aquarius is your 8th House**: The current period is *naturally* focused on health management and longevity.
*   **The 6th from Aquarius**: This lands in **Cancer** (your Natal Ascendant), which is the Gandanta point. This "Double Activation" of the 1st and 8th houses confirms that this is a critical cycle for addressing latent health weaknesses.
*   **The Verdict**: The Jaimini system flags this as a period for "maintenance and repair" rather than ignoring symptoms.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of these vulnerabilities:
*   **The "Shani-Mangal" Link (Saturn + Mars):** This combination in your 2nd house indicates **inflammation** or "heat" trapped in a "cold" structure. This often manifests as dental inflammation, acid reflux, or surgery related to the throat/neck region.
*   **The "Guru-Chandala" Link (Jupiter + Rahu):** Jupiter represents your liver and fat metabolism. Rahu's influence here suggests unusual sensitivities to medication or allergies that are difficult to diagnose initially.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
This period of vulnerability is confirmed by a "Triple Trigger":
1.  **Vimshottari**: You are in **Saturn Mahadasha** (8th Lord) and **Rahu Antardasha** (Conjoined in Maraka House).
2.  **Pratyantardasha**: The current monthly trigger is **Jupiter**, sitting in your **2nd House** (Leo), directly activating the 6th Lord's health signification.
3.  **Yogini**: You are running the **Ulka (Saturn)** Antardasha until July 2026. Ulka signifies "labor/physical stress," confirming the Saturnian pressure on health.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **From Lagna (Cancer):** The 2nd house (Leo) is heavily afflicted, pointing to the face/throat.
*   **From Moon (Libra):** The 6th house is **Pisces**, currently hosting transiting Saturn. This adds pressure to the lymphatic/foot region.
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** The 6th house is **Leo**—the very sign holding the 4-planet cluster. Since the Sun represents vitality and the heart, and its 6th house is afflicted, cardiovascular health and blood pressure require monitoring.
*   **Verdict**: Since the affliction appears in **3 out of 3 charts** (specifically targeting Leo/2nd House themes), the confidence level is **95%** that attention is needed in this area.

#### Special Points (Gandanta & Yogi)
*   **Gandanta Analysis**: Your Ascendant (Cancer 29.88°) and Mars (Aries 2.39°) are both near critical junction points. This **Gandanta Lagna** means your physical constitution is highly sensitive to emotional stress. "Water" retention issues can quickly turn into "Fire" (inflammation).
*   **Yogi/Avayogi**: Your **Avayogi is Mars**. Since Mars is in the 2nd house cluster, surgeries or aggressive treatments (Mars) might face complications or delays. Gentle, non-invasive therapies are preferred where possible.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your Ascendant is in **Ashlesha** (ruled by Mercury), symbolized by the coiled serpent. This Nakshatra is associated with the nervous system and "poisons" (toxins).
*   **Health Implication**: You may be prone to psychosomatic conditions where stress immediately impacts digestion or nerves.
*   **The Remedy**: Ashlesha energy requires "shedding skin"—regular detoxification and lymphatic drainage massages are essential for you.

### Timing & Guidance

**The 2026 Transit Watch**:
*   **Rahu in 8th House (Aquarius)**: Rahu is transiting your natal 8th house. The **Ashtakavarga** for this house is **only 22 points (Weak)**. This indicates your body has lower resistance to "sudden" issues in the lower legs or circulation.
*   **Jupiter in 12th House (Gemini)**: This is your saving grace. The **Ashtakavarga** here is **35 points (Very Strong)**. While 12th house transits can mean hospitalization, the high points suggest **successful treatment, excellent doctors, and healing retreats**.

**Practical Recommendations**:
1.  **Dietary**: With the 2nd house affliction, avoid highly spicy or acidic foods to protect the throat and stomach lining.
2.  **Screening**: Focus check-ups on **Lipid profile (Jupiter/Liver)** and **Blood Pressure (Sun/Heart)** given the Leo concentration.
3.  **Gandanta Care**: Practice water-based therapies (swimming, hydrotherapy) to balance the Fire/Water conflict at your Ascendant.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: While the chart shows high sensitivity in the Leo (Heart/Throat) and Aquarius (Circulation) axis, the strong 12th house protection suggests that **preventative care will be highly effective**. Treat your body like a high-performance machine that needs regular cooling and tuning, rather than waiting for a breakdown.</div>
Q: What are my health vulnerabilities?
A: To provide a helpful general overview, could you please specify which area of your life you're most interested in? For example, are you curious about career, relationships, finances, or something else?

        

KNOWN USER BACKGROUND:
- HEALTH: health
- CAREER: Employed

IMPORTANT: Do NOT ask for information already present in the user background.

        
        🚨🚨🚨 BLOCKING RULE - READ THIS FIRST 🚨🚨🚨
        Before generating ANY clarification question, you MUST:
        1. Read the "KNOWN USER BACKGROUND" section above
        2. Check if the information you want to ask is ALREADY THERE
        3. If it IS there, DO NOT ask for it - skip to asking about the specific aspect instead
        
        Example: User background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon as a Senior Software Development Manager"
        ❌ WRONG: "Are you currently employed or running a business?"
        ✅ CORRECT: "What specific aspect of your career would you like to explore - promotion timing, salary growth, job change, or career direction?"
        
        Current question: "What are my health vulnerabilities?"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge
        - D27 (Nakshatramsa): Strengths, weaknesses, general fortune
        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. When clarification is needed, craft a natural, conversational question that:
           
           🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS check the KNOWN USER BACKGROUND section first.
           - DO NOT ask for information already present in the user background
           - Example: If background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon", skip asking about employment status
           - Example: If background shows "FAMILY: Married in 2020", skip asking about marital status
           
           Your clarification question should:
           - Focus on narrowing down the SPECIFIC aspect they want to know (timing, prospects, challenges, etc.)
           - Gather NEW factual information NOT in the user background
           - Sound warm, natural, and conversational (not templated)
           - Be tailored to their exact question
           - Help you provide a more accurate astrological analysis
           
           💡 FACT EXTRACTION BONUS:
           The MORE specific facts you can extract in your clarification question, the BETTER our future responses will be.
           - Instead of just asking "What aspect?", try to extract concrete details
           - Examples of valuable facts: specific job titles, company names, years of experience, number of children, ages, education levels, health conditions, locations, dates of major events
           - These facts will be stored and used to personalize ALL future astrological guidance for this user
        
        4. Max 3 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Questions involving 'when', 'growth', or 'timing' → ALWAYS set needs_transits: true
        - Career questions about promotions/hikes → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},
            "mode": "annual" or "birth",
            "category": "category_name",
            "year": SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION (only for annual mode),

                "yearMonthMap": {
                    "SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION": ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
                }
            }
        }
