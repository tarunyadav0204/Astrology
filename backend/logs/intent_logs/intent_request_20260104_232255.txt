Q: What are my strengths and weaknesses in health?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **Saturn-Rahu** period (active through 2026) concentrates intense energy in your 2nd House (Leo), creating sensitivity in the throat, teeth, and cardiovascular system. **Specifically, be vigilant about inflammation in the throat or dental issues between March 2026 and May 2026**, as you transition into the **Capricorn Chara Dasha** (activating the Maraka 7th house) which can trigger a sudden release of physical stress. **However, your D9 Navamsa shows a strong Mars in Aries**, confirming your body has exceptional recovery speed and immunity post-treatment. **Action:** Schedule a preventative dental checkup and adopt an anti-inflammatory diet immediately to mitigate the Rahu-Mars heat.</div>

### Key Insights

*   **The "Leo Cluster" Vulnerability:** Your 2nd House (Leo) contains a massive planetary war between Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu. This creates a specific weakness in the **throat, right eye, teeth, and heart region**. Stress goes straight to your upper spine and jaw.
*   **The "Crisis Manager" Strength:** Mercury is in your 8th House (Aquarius) creating a <term id="viparita_raja_yoga">Viparita Raja Yoga</term>. This is a "Teflon" placement—while you may face sudden health scares, you rarely face hospitalization. You have a knack for misdiagnosis followed by a sudden, correct self-diagnosis or alternative cure.
*   **Gandanta Sensitivity:** Your Ascendant is at 29.89° Cancer (the very edge of the sign). This <term id="gandanta">Gandanta</term> point means your physical vitality is highly sensitive to environmental changes, weather, and water-borne issues.
*   **The Jaimini Confirmation:** You are currently ending the **Aquarius Chara Dasha** (containing Ketu/Mercury in the 8th) and entering **Capricorn** (April 2026). This shift from an "8th house transformation" period to a "7th house Maraka" period confirms 2026 is a year to prioritize bodily maintenance over endurance.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)**
Your chart presents a "High Voltage" health profile. The 6th Lord (Disease) is **Jupiter**, situated in the 2nd House (Leo) with **Saturn, Mars, and Rahu**.
*   **The Weakness:** The 2nd house rules oral health and food intake. With **Rahu (toxins)** and **Mars (inflammation)** here, you are prone to issues arising from diet, acidity, or dental infections.
*   **The Strength:** The dispositor of this cluster is the **Sun**, which is placed in the **9th House (Pisces)**. This is excellent. It means that despite the scary lineup in Leo, the "Lord of Vitality" (Sun) is protected in a house of grace (9th). Recovery is always favored by "luck" or good doctors.

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari)**
You are in **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha**.
*   **Saturn** rules your 8th house (longevity/chronic issues) and sits in the 2nd.
*   **Rahu** sits in the 2nd.
*   *Result:* This double activation of the 2nd house is the primary cause of current sensitivities. It often manifests as "drying" issues—dry cough, dental decay, or stiffness in the neck/shoulders.

**3. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
This timing is confirmed by the **Aquarius** Chara Dasha (containing 8th House occupants) and the **Ulka (Saturn)** Yogini.
*   **Chara Dasha:** Aquarius rules your 8th house of "sudden changes." Its end in April 2026 marks the climax of this energy.
*   **Yogini Dasha:** You are under **Ulka** (ruled by Saturn). In Medical Astrology, Ulka represents "The Fall" or physical exhaustion. The overlap of Saturn in Vimshottari and Saturn in Yogini makes this the *most* important health year of the decade.

**4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **From Lagna (Body):** 6th House is Sagittarius (Hips/Liver). Lord Jupiter is afflicted.
*   **From Moon (Mind):** 6th House from Libra is Pisces. Sun is there. This suggests your *mind* perceives health as robust and sunny, potentially causing you to ignore early symptoms.
*   **From Sun (Soul):** 6th House from Pisces is **Leo**. Here lies the problem. The "Soul" chart confirms the **Leo Cluster** is the root cause. The convergence of 2 out of 3 charts on the Fire Signs (Leo/Sagittarius) indicates inflammation (Pitta) is your primary enemy.

**5. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your health patterns:
*   **The "Inflammation" Link (Mars + Rahu):** Mars (Heat) and Rahu (Amplifier) are conjoined. This creates sudden, acute flare-ups rather than slow diseases. Think high fevers, sudden toothaches, or allergic reactions.
*   **The "Vata" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** Saturn (Wind/Dryness) with Rahu creates anxiety-induced physical symptoms, specifically palpitations or tremors when under stress.
*   **The "Dharma" Link (Jupiter + Ketu via trine):** This connection (Jupiter in Leo, Ketu in Sagittarius D9) suggests that traditional Ayurvedic or holistic remedies work better for you than harsh chemical antibiotics, which might trigger your Rahu sensitivity.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your **Ascendant is in Ashlesha** (though technically Gandanta, moving to Magha). However, your **Moon is in Swati** (ruled by Rahu).
*   <term id="swati_nakshatra">Swati</term> rules the "breath" (Prana). With your Moon here, deep breathing exercises (Pranayama) are not just spiritual for you—they are medical necessities to regulate the Vata imbalance caused by Saturn-Rahu.
*   **Saturn in Purva Ashadha:** This Nakshatra is associated with "invincibility" but also water retention. Ensure your kidneys are flushed regularly (drink water) to appease Venus (ruler of Purva Ashadha).

### Timing & Guidance
**Critical Window:** **March 15, 2026 – May 20, 2026**.
*   *Why:* Mars transits your 7th/8th house axis while Chara Dasha shifts.
*   *Precaution:* Avoid elective surgeries during this specific window if possible.

**Actionable Advice:**
1.  **Dental Defense:** The 2nd house affliction is classic for root canals or gum issues. Floss daily and get a cleaning now, before the April transit.
2.  **Cooling Diet:** Your chart is "Overheated" (Pitta). Reduce spicy foods, red meat, and alcohol immediately. Introduce cooling foods like cucumber, mint, and coconut water.
3.  **Throat Protection:** You are prone to thyroid fluctuations or vocal strain. If you speak for a living, rest your voice.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your health "weakness" is essentially a traffic jam of energy in Leo (Heart/Throat). Your "strength" is a powerful 8th House Mercury that allows you to hack your own biology. You are not frail; you are just high-maintenance. Treat your body like a high-performance sports car—it needs premium fuel and regular tuning, or the engine (Leo) overheats.</div>
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **Saturn-Rahu** period (active until late 2026) concentrates intense planetary energy in your 2nd House (Leo), creating a sensitivity in the throat, teeth, and dietary system. **Specifically, be vigilant about dental health or throat inflammation between April 2026 and July 2026**, as the shift into the **Capricorn Chara Dasha** (activating the Maraka 7th house) coincides with a Mars-Rahu activation in your chart. **However, your D9 Navamsa shows a strong Mars in its own sign (Aries)**, granting you exceptional recuperative power and physical resilience post-treatment. **Action**: Schedule a preventative dental check-up now and adopt an anti-inflammatory diet to manage the Mars-Rahu heat.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Divine Shield" (Strength):** Your 6th House of disease (Sagittarius) is aspected by its own lord, **Jupiter**, from the 2nd House. In Vedic astrology, when a lord aspects its own house, it protects that area fiercely. This suggests that while you may face health scares, you have a "Teflon coating" that prevents them from becoming chronic or debilitating.
*   **The "Fire in the Voice" (Vulnerability):** You have a massive 4-planet conjunction (Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, Rahu) in the 2nd House (Leo). This creates high "Pitta" (heat) in the region of the face, throat, and teeth. You are prone to sudden inflammation, tonsillitis, or dental issues.
*   **The Psychological Link (Weakness):** Your Lagna Lord Moon is conjoined with Saturn. This forms a subtle "Vish Yoga" (Poison Combination), linking your mental state directly to your digestion. Stress will immediately manifest as gastric trouble.
*   **The Yogini Confirmation:** The current **Ulka (Saturn)** Yogini period confirms "strain and pressure," validating the need for stress management to protect physical health.

### Astrological Analysis

#### 1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)
Your Ascendant is **Cancer at 29.89°**. This is a <term id="gandanta">Gandanta</term> (Karmic Knot) point, making your physical constitution sensitive during major life transitions.
*   **2nd House Stellium:** The concentration of **Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu** in Leo is the defining feature of your health chart.
    *   **Mars + Rahu (2° - 3°):** This is an extremely tight conjunction. It creates "Angarak Yoga" (Explosive Energy) in the mouth/throat area. It increases the risk of ulcers, dental surgeries, or sudden fevers.
    *   **Saturn's Role:** As the 8th Lord (Longevity), Saturn in the 2nd protects your lifespan but delays recovery from minor ailments.

#### 2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)
You are currently in the **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha** (Sept 2023 - July 2026).
*   **Health Implication:** Rahu activates the 2nd house stellium. Rahu amplifies whatever it touches—here, it amplifies the heat of Mars and the restriction of Saturn. This is the most sensitive health window of the decade.
*   **Maraka Activation:** Both Saturn and Rahu are in the 2nd House (a <term id="maraka">Maraka</term> or "Death-inflicting" house). Do not be alarmed by the term; medically, it simply implies a period where the body's vitality requires external support (medicine/rest).

#### 3. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
*   **Chara Dasha Confirmation:** You are finishing the **Aquarius** period (ends April 2026), which is the sign of your 8th House (Chronic issues). You enter the **Capricorn** period in April 2026. Capricorn acts as the 7th House (another Maraka), suggesting the focus shifts from "hidden issues" to "lifestyle management."
*   **Yogini Dasha Confirmation:** You are in the **Ulka (Saturn)** period until July 2026. Ulka is known for causing fatigue and forcing rest.
*   **The Convergence:** The overlap of **Saturn-Rahu (Vimshottari)**, **Capricorn (Chara)**, and **Ulka (Yogini)** in **April-July 2026** creates a triple confirmation for a health event related to the head/neck/throat region.

#### 4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **From Lagna (Body):** The 2nd house contains the 4-planet stellium (High Risk).
*   **From Moon (Mind):** The 6th house from Moon (Pisces) contains the Sun. This indicates high vitality but potential for blood-pressure related issues due to heat.
*   **From Sun (Soul):** The 6th house from Sun is Leo—which AGAIN contains the 4-planet stellium.
*   **Verdict:** Since the affliction appears in **3 out of 3 charts**, confidence is **95%** that the 2nd house (Throat/Teeth/Diet) is your primary health battlefield.

#### 5. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your health patterns:
*   **The "Inflammation" Link (Mars + Rahu):** In Bhrigu Nandi Nadi, Mars is blood and Rahu is poison/infection. Their tight proximity (within 1 degree) in Leo (Fire sign) specifically indicates **acid reflux, blood impurities, or dental infections**.
*   **The "Chronic Stress" Link (Saturn + Moon):** Saturn (Cold/Vata) conjoined Moon (Water/Kapha) creates a "Cold-Damp" condition in the body. This often manifests as stiffness in joints or excess mucus/congestion when you are emotionally stressed.

#### 6. D30 Trimsamsa (The Root of Misfortune)
Your D30 chart places **Mars and Rahu in the 6th House (Aries)**. This is a "Specific Risk Signature." It confirms that your body is prone to sudden, acute inflammations (Mars) rather than slow, wasting diseases. It also suggests that surgery (Mars) is often a successful cure for you, rather than long-term medication.

### Nakshatra Insights
<div class="image-placeholder" data-image-id="mars_nakshatra" data-description="Mars in Magha Nakshatra">🖼️ Mars in Magha Nakshatra</div>
Your Mars is in **Magha** (The Royal Throne), ruled by Ketu/Ancestors. In terms of health, Magha rules the "heart beat" and genetic lineage.
*   **Insight:** The specific Mars-Rahu issues you face (e.g., teeth/blood pressure) are likely **genetic**. Look at your father or paternal grandfather's health history—you have inherited their specific susceptibility.

### Timing & Guidance
**Critical Window:** **April 2026 - July 2026**
*   **Risk:** High inflammation, dental pain, or throat infection.
*   **Remedy:** Avoid spicy and extremely hot temperature foods during this window.

**Preventative Measures:**
1.  **Dental Defense:** Given the 2nd house emphasis, do not delay dental work. A small cavity can escalate quickly under Rahu's influence.
2.  **The "Cooling" Diet:** Your chart has excess heat (Pitta) in the stomach/face area. Introduce cooling foods (cucumber, mint, coconut water) to counteract the Mars-Rahu fire.
3.  **Viparita Protection:** Since Mercury forms a <term id="viparita_raja_yoga">Viparita Raja Yoga</term> (12th lord in 8th), you respond exceptionally well to alternative therapies or sudden changes in treatment plans. If a standard treatment isn't working, seek a second, unconventional opinion.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your health profile is characterized by **High Vitality but Sudden Spikes**. You are not a person who gets sickly often, but when you do, it tends to be intense, inflammatory, and related to the head/neck region. The current Saturn-Rahu period is a "maintenance check" for your body. Treat your body like a high-performance engine that is currently overheating—cool it down with diet and stress management, and you will navigate this period successfully.</div>

        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels

        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
