================================================================================

        You are a clarification assistant for an astrology chatbot. Your job is to determine if a question is too vague and needs clarification.
        

Previous conversation:
Q: What are my strengths and weaknesses?
A: Career
Q: What are my health vulnerabilities?
A: I can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses! Which area are you interested in? Career, relationships, finances, personal growth, or something else?
Q: What are my strengths and weaknesses in terms of health?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Based on your chart, you are currently navigating a sensitive health period defined by the **Saturn-Rahu** <term id="vimshottari">Vimshottari</term> cycle and the **Aquarius** <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term> (your 8th house of chronic vulnerability).

Specifically, expect vulnerabilities related to **Pitta (Heat/Inflammation)** affecting the **stomach, throat/teeth, and blood pressure** between **September 2025 and July 2026**, triggered by the active **Ulka (Saturn)** Yogini period.

However, your <term id="d9">D9</term> Navamsa Mars is in its own sign (Aries), indicating **exceptional recuperative power**. While you may experience acute flare-ups (fevers/inflammation), your body has a "fighter's constitution" that recovers quickly if you manage your diet strictly.

**Action:** Implement an anti-inflammatory diet immediately to cool the massive planetary cluster in your Leo (fire) sector.</div>

### Key Insights

*   **The Lagna "Sandhi" Challenge:** Your Ascendant is at **29.89° Cancer**, a "Gandanta" point. This acts like a flickering lightbulb—your physical vitality fluctuates. You are highly sensitive to environmental changes and stress, requiring more rest than the average person.
*   **The Leo Cluster (2nd House):** You have a massive conjunction of **Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, and Rahu** all in Leo. This creates a "pressure cooker" in the sign ruling the **heart, spine, and stomach**.
*   **The Jaimini Confirmation:** You are currently in the **Aquarius** <term id="charadasha">Chara Dasha</term> (2020–2026). Since Aquarius is your **8th House** (longevity/chronic issues) and contains Ketu, this double-confirms the current period as the most physically sensitive cycle of the decade.
*   **Strength Factor:** The 6th Lord (Jupiter) is Vargottama? No, but **Mars is strong in D9**. This cancels "weakness" and replaces it with "resilience." You get sick suddenly, but heal largely through willpower.

### Astrological Analysis

#### 1. The Promise (Root vs. Fruit)
*   **D1 (The Symptom):** Your Lagna Lord, **Moon**, is in Libra, which is generally balanced. However, the **6th Lord (Jupiter)**—representing disease—is Retrograde in the 2nd House (Leo) and joined by **Mars, Saturn, and Rahu**. This indicates that health issues likely originate from **dietary habits (2nd House)** and manifest as **heat/inflammation (Mars/Leo)** or **toxic accumulation (Rahu)**.
*   **D9 (The Outcome):** In the Navamsa, **Mars (vitality)** shifts to **Aries (Own Sign)**. This is a massive boon. It implies that while the D1 shows complex symptoms, the D9 shows the internal heat to burn off infection. You are a survivor.

#### 2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari & Transits)
You are in the **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha**.
*   **Saturn** rules your 7th and **8th House** (Chronic Health).
*   **Rahu** is situated in the 2nd House (Maraka/Death-inflicting house) within that volatile Leo cluster.
*   **The Trigger:** This combination specifically targets the "mouth to stomach" channel. Rahu in 2nd can cause obscure allergies or issues with teeth/gums that are hard to diagnose.

#### 3. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your vulnerabilities:

*   **The "Guru-Mangal-Rahu" Link (Jupiter + Mars + Rahu):** In Nadi, Jupiter is the *Jiva* (Life Force). It is conjoined with Mars (Injury/Heat) and Rahu (Poison/Foreign bodies). This specific combo indicates a susceptibility to **blood impurities, high blood pressure, or acid reflux**.
*   **The "Shani-Rahu" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** Saturn is the karaka for longevity. Its proximity to Rahu in a fire sign (Leo) often creates **"Vata-Pitta" imbalances**—specifically anxiety manifesting as digestive burning or stiffness in the upper spine/neck.

#### 4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
Comparing the **6th House (Health)** from three vantage points:
*   **From Lagna (Cancer):** 6th House is Sagittarius. Lord Jupiter is heavily afflicted in Leo. (Indicates digestive/liver stress).
*   **From Moon (Libra):** 6th House is Pisces. Contains Sun (Vitality). (Indicates sensitivity to eyes or heart rhythm).
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** 6th House is Leo. Contains the **Four-Planet Cluster**.
*   **Verdict:** Since the **Leo Cluster** is the 6th from the Sun (Body/Soul), this is the "Triple Confirmation." The primary vulnerability is **Cardiovascular or Digestive Heat**.

#### 5. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
The current health sensitivity is not random; it is structurally timed:
*   **Vimshottari:** Saturn-Rahu (Maraka activation).
*   **Chara Dasha:** Running **Aquarius** (8th House sign), which aspects the Leo cluster via Rashi Drishti.
*   **Yogini Dasha:** The **Ulka (Saturn)** period is active from **Sept 2025 to July 2026**. Ulka is associated with labor and physical strain.
*   **Synthesis:** The convergence of Saturn-Rahu (Vimshottari), Aquarius (Chara), and Ulka (Yogini) makes **late 2025 to mid-2026** the critical window for management.

---

### Nakshatra Insights
*   **Moon in Swati (Libra):** Swati rules "Prana" or wind. You are susceptible to gas, bloating, and nervous exhaustion when stressed.
*   **Saturn in Purva Ashadha:** This Nakshatra is related to fluids. Saturn here can cause "drying up" of necessary fluids (synovial fluid in joints) or issues with the bladder.
*   **Sun in Revati:** Revati rules the feet and lymphatic system. With Sun here in the 8th from Moon (roughly), be careful of foot injuries or water retention.

---

### Timing & Guidance

**Critical Window:** **September 2025 – July 2026**
*   **Why:** Yogini **Ulka** (Saturn) aligns with Vimshottari **Saturn-Rahu**.
*   **Event:** High probability of a dental issue, throat infection, or acidity flare-up that requires attention.

**Actionable Advice:**
1.  **Dietary Cooling:** Your 2nd house (food) is on fire (Leo + Mars/Rahu). Avoid spicy foods, alcohol, and excessive caffeine. Alkaline diets are your best astrological remedy.
2.  **Spine/Neck Care:** The Leo cluster affects the upper back. Yoga focusing on the spine is essential to prevent stiffness caused by Saturn.
3.  **Remedy:** Since Saturn and Rahu are the culprits, charitable acts involving feeding the hungry (calming the 2nd house) on Saturdays are effective.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your chart is not "weak," but it is "hot" and "pressurized." Your 29° Ascendant gives you a delicate sensitivity, but your Exalted/Own-Sign D9 Mars gives you the engine of a warrior. Treat your body like a high-performance sports car—it needs premium fuel (diet) and careful maintenance, or it overheats. 2026 is a maintenance year; handle it with discipline, and you will emerge stronger.</div>

        Current question: "Career"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge
        - D27 (Nakshatramsa): Strengths, weaknesses, general fortune
        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2027

        Return ONLY a JSON object:

            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},

                }
            }
        }
