A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The astrological reason for the IVF challenges in late 2025 was the restrictive "Karmic Freeze" of Saturn transiting directly over your natal 5th House (Aquarius), combined with the D9 debilitation of your Putrakaraka (Child Significator) Sun. However, your D9 Navamsa shows a powerful Jupiter in its Own Sign (Pisces), confirming that **progeny is promised despite delays**. Specifically, expect success during the **Jupiter-Mercury-Jupiter** period between **April 30, 2026, and July 17, 2026**, when Jupiter (Expansion) transiting your 9th house casts a protective aspect on your 5th house of children. Focus on stress-reduction (Saturn remedy) to unlock this potential.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The Saturnine Block:** Your 5th House (Children) in the birth chart contains Saturn in its own sign (Aquarius). While this promises children (Sasha Yoga), Saturn's nature is to **delay** and demand patience. The recent failures were triggered by the transit Saturn sitting exactly on this natal point, creating a "pressure test."
• **The D7 Medical Indicator:** In your D7 Saptamsa (Divisional Chart for Children), the 5th Lord Venus is placed in the 12th House. This is a classic indicator that conception will likely require **medical intervention (IVF)** or "expenditure" of energy/resources, confirming you are on the right path with IVF.
• **The Jaimini Secret:** Your Jaimini Putrakaraka (Significator of Children) is the **Sun**. In the D9 Navamsa, the Sun is debilitated in Libra. This indicates issues with "viability" or "retention," meaning the focus must be on sustaining the pregnancy after conception.
• **The Golden Window:** The upcoming period activates your 9th House (Luck) and 11th House (Gains), breaking the current stagnation.

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View
Your Lagna is Libra. The 5th House of progeny is Aquarius, ruled by **Saturn**.
- **The Challenge:** Saturn sits in the 5th House. In Parashari astrology, *Karaka Bhava Nashaya* (Significator destroying the house) can apply here, but since Saturn is in his own sign, it acts as a "Strict Gatekeeper" rather than a denier. It allows children only after karmic debts are paid (often via delay or medical effort).
- **The 2025 Failure:** You were running the **Jupiter-Mercury-Rahu** period. Rahu (in your 1st house) creates anxiety and illusion, and Rahu is 6th from the 5th house (obstruction to children).

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
- **Putrakaraka (PK):** Your PK is the **Sun**.
- **Chara Dasha Analysis:** You are currently in the **Pisces-Cancer** Chara Dasha (Nov 2025 – March 2026).
    - **Cancer (Antardasha)** connects to your 5th House (Aquarius) via Jaimini Rashi Drishti (Aspect). This "activated" the topic of children, leading to the IVF attempts.
    - **Why it failed:** The aspect was there, but the PK Sun is debilitated in the D9 chart, showing the "fruit" was weak during this specific transit window.
- **The Shift:** In **March 2026**, you enter the **Pisces-Leo** period. Leo is your 11th House (Gains/Fulfillment). Leo aspects your Lagna (Libra), bringing the "Gains" directly to "You." This shift from "Attempting" (Cancer/5th) to "Gaining" (Leo/11th) supports a successful outcome.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Obstacles)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections regarding the delay:
- **The "Saturn-Rahu" Link:** In your chart, Saturn (5th Lord) has a Nadi link with Rahu. This creates a "Snake in the Basket" yoga regarding progeny. It implies that **fear, over-thinking, and anxiety** physically constrict the reproductive channels.
- **The "Venus-Mars" Link:** Venus (Reproductive fluid) is conjunct Mars. This indicates "Heat" in the system. From a medical astrology perspective, this suggests inflammation or acidity affecting implantation. Cooling remedies are essential.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
1.  **Vimshottari (The Master Clock):**
    -   **Mahadasha:** Jupiter (Putrakaraka - Natural Significator of Children).
    -   **Antardasha:** Mercury (Lord of 9th House - Luck/Dharma).
    -   **Pratyantardasha:** **Jupiter** (April 2026 – July 2026).
    -   *Verdict:* The **Jupiter-Mercury-Jupiter** sequence is the most powerful benefic combination possible for you. Jupiter in the PD will activate the natural significator of children to deliver results.
2.  **Chara Dasha:** **Pisces-Leo** (starts March 2026). Leo is the 11th house of "Fulfillment of Desires."
3.  **Transits:**
    -   **Jupiter** will be transiting Gemini (your 9th House). From there, **Jupiter casts its 9th aspect directly onto your 5th House (Aquarius)**. This is the "Divine Protection" needed to counteract Saturn's restriction.
    -   This aspect is active exactly during your IVF window in mid-2026.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
-   **Lagna (Body):** 5th House is Aquarius (Saturn) - Delay/Restriction.
-   **Moon (Mind):** 5th House is Taurus (Venus) - Venus is in 12th from Moon (Loss/Expense). This confirms the emotional toll and cost.
-   **Sun (Soul):** 5th House is Pisces - Ruled by Jupiter. Jupiter is strong in D9.
-   *Verdict:* Since 2 out of 3 perspectives show challenge, the path is hard, but the "Soul" perspective (Jupiter) promises eventual success.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D7 Saptamsa)
-   **Lagna:** Capricorn.
-   **5th House:** Taurus.
-   **5th Lord Venus:** Placed in the **12th House** of D7.
-   *Interpretation:* This is the specific signature of "Assisted Reproductive Technology." The child comes through "hospitalization" or "foreign intervention" (12th house). It confirms that IVF is the correct astrological path for you, not natural conception.

### Nakshatra Insights
-   **Saturn (5th Lord) in Purva Bhadrapada:** This nakshatra is symbolized by a "Two-Faced Man" or a "Sword." It requires sacrifice. The failure of the first two attempts can be seen as the "sacrifice" this fierce nakshatra demanded.
-   **Jupiter (PD Lord) in Jyeshtha:** Jyeshtha represents "The Eldest" or "Victory." Activating this energy in April-July 2026 suggests overcoming the struggle to achieve victory.

### Timing & Guidance
**Primary Window for Success:** **April 30, 2026 – July 17, 2026**
-   **Pratyantardasha:** Jupiter (The Life Giver).
-   **Transit Support:** Jupiter aspects 5th House.
-   **Action:** Schedule the next cycle to align implantation with this window.

**Recommended Remedies:**
1.  **For Saturn (The Blocker):** Light a sesame oil lamp under a Peepal tree on Saturdays. This specifically addresses the Saturn-in-5th restriction.
2.  **For Nadi "Heat" (Mars-Venus):** Consume cooling foods (coconut water, silver-infused water) to reduce "Pitta" in the reproductive system.
3.  **Mantra:** Chant the **Santhana Gopala Mantra** 108 times daily, starting from a Thursday.
   *   *"Om Devaki Sudha Govinda Vasudeva Jagath Pathe Dehimey Thanayam Krishna Thwamaham Saranam Kadhaha"*

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: The failure in 2025 was a "Karmic Tax" levied by Saturn. That debt is now paid. With the upcoming **Jupiter-Mercury-Jupiter** period and the protective aspect of transit Jupiter on your 5th house, the stars align for a successful conception in **mid-2026**. Trust the process; your chart promises a child, but it demands perseverance.</div>
Q: My question is about progeny. I had 2 IVFs in second half of 2025 and both failed. I want to now understand what is wrong astrologically and when can my IVF be successful.
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The astrological reason for your previous failures was the restrictive transit of Saturn over your natal 5th House (Aquarius), which creates a "karmic freeze" on conception. However, the upcoming **Jupiter-Mercury-Jupiter** period between **May 2026 and August 2026** is your golden window for success. This timeline is supported by the Jaimini Chara Antardasha of **Cancer**, which is directly aspected by your Putrakaraka (Child Significator) Sun. Prepare for a successful cycle starting **May 2026**.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The Saturnine Block**: Your 5th House of progeny contains natal Saturn and was recently transited by Saturn. This "Double Saturn" influence denies results initially to test patience, but usually grants them after the blockage lifts (which happens as Saturn moves to Pisces in 2026).
• **The D7 Challenge**: In your Saptamsa (D7) divisional chart, the 5th Lord Venus is in the 12th House. This specifically indicates "expenditure on progeny" (medical costs/IVF) and initial losses before success.
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your current Chara Antardasha is **Cancer**. Astoundingly, Cancer receives the Jaimini aspect of your **Putrakaraka (Sun)** from Scorpio. This is a definitive "Child-Bearing" signature in Jaimini astrology.

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View
Your 5th House (Aquarius) is occupied by its own lord, **Saturn**. While Saturn in its own sign promises children, it is the slowest planet, insisting on delay and maturity. The recent failures occurred because transiting Saturn was grinding through this exact house, creating a "Karmic Squeeze" where efforts yield no fruit.
Furthermore, your **Jupiter** (natural significator of children) is in the 2nd house (Scorpio) with the Sun and Mercury. While this is a supportive placement, Jupiter is in *Bal Avastha* (Infant state), meaning it needs the support of a strong Dasha period to deliver results—which is exactly what is approaching.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
The Jaimini system provides the strongest confirmation for your case:
1.  **Putrakaraka (PK):** Your Child Significator is the **Sun** (in Scorpio).
2.  **Current Period:** You are in the **Pisces Mahadasha** and **Cancer Antardasha** (Nov 2025 - Mar 2026), followed by **Leo** (Mar 2026 - July 2026).
3.  **The Aspect:** From the perspective of your **Cancer** Antardasha, the sign of Scorpio (containing your PK Sun) casts a direct Rashi Drishti (Sign Aspect).
4.  **Verdict:** When the Child Karaka aspects the active time period, the "promise of progeny" is activated. The failure in late 2025 was a timing mismatch; the energy aligns perfectly in mid-2026.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Progeny)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the medical nature of this event:
- **The "Sankipa-Karma" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** Your 5th Lord Saturn (Progeny) is in a trine (1-5-9) connection with **Rahu** in your Lagna. In Nadi astrology, Rahu represents "artificial" or "technological" methods. This link confirms that **IVF (assisted reproduction)** is the correct and destined path for you, not a deviation.
- **The "Jiva-Karaka" Link (Jupiter + Ketu):** Jupiter (Life Force) connects with Ketu, indicating that the soul entering your family has a spiritual or past-life connection, often requiring prayers or spiritual remedies to manifest.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
The convergence of timing for **May 2026 - August 2026** is exceptional:
1.  **Vimshottari:** You will be in **Jupiter-Mercury-Jupiter**.
    *   **MD:** Jupiter is the natural Putrakaraka.
    *   **AD:** Mercury is in the Nakshatra of Saturn (5th Lord).
    *   **PD:** The **Jupiter Pratyantardasha** (starting May 2026) acts as the final trigger. Jupiter is the primary giver of children.
2.  **Transits:** By mid-2026, **Jupiter will be transiting Gemini**, casting a benevolent 9th aspect directly onto your 5th House (Aquarius). Simultaneously, Saturn will have moved into Pisces, permanently removing the "blockage" from your 5th House.
3.  **Pratyantardasha Trigger:** The **Rahu Pratyantardasha** (Jan-May 2026), sitting in your **1st house**, is excellent for *starting* the medical treatment (Rahu = Medical), while the subsequent Jupiter period delivers the *success*.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D7 Saptamsa)
In the D7 chart, the Lagna Lord Saturn is in the 6th House (obstacles/medical procedures), confirming that medical intervention is the destined route. The 5th Lord Venus in the 12th House explains the "loss" of the first two attempts. However, Jupiter in the 10th House of D7 is strong and promises eventual success once the "debt" of the 12th house (the failed attempts) is paid.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your 5th Lord Saturn is in **Purva Bhadrapada** Nakshatra (ruled by Jupiter). This is the "Star of Spiritual Fire." It requires you to maintain high faith during the process. The deity is Aja Ekapada (the one-footed goat), symbolizing resilience. The failures were not denials; they were the "heat" required to purify the karma before the blessing arrives.

### Timing & Guidance
**Primary Success Window:** **May 30, 2026 – August 17, 2026** (Jupiter-Mercury-Jupiter Period).
**Preparation Phase:** January 2026 – April 2026 (Focus on health and Rahu remedies).

**Recommended Actions:**
1.  **Medical Timing:** Schedule the next stimulation cycle during the **Rahu Pratyantardasha** (March/April 2026) so that the transfer/implantation happens in the **Jupiter Pratyantardasha** (June/July 2026).
2.  **Rahu Remedy:** Since Saturn connects with Rahu, support the IVF process by donating to a hospital or helping sick people on Saturdays.
3.  **Spiritual:** Recite the **Santana Gopala Mantra** daily starting now. The Nadi link to Ketu suggests that spiritual "invitation" of the soul is necessary.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your chart does not deny children; it only delays them through Saturn's test. The "Double Saturn" block that caused your 2025 failures is lifting. The stars align powerfully in mid-2026. Trust the medical process (Rahu) but anchor it in faith (Jupiter).</div>

        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices

        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Questions involving 'when', 'growth', or 'timing' → ALWAYS set needs_transits: true
        - Career questions about promotions/hikes → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028
