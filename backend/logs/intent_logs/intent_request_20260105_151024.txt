Q: Employed, Will I get a salary hike in 2026
A: What does my birth chart say about my career? Currently employed, looking for salary hike
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **Saturn-Rahu period** (active throughout early 2026) specifically targets your **2nd House of Accumulated Wealth**, creating a powerful window for financial elevation. Specifically, expect the salary hike or restructuring to materialize between **April 2, 2026, and July 6, 2026**.

While your D1 chart shows intense pressure due to the **Planetary War** in your finance sector, your **D9 Navamsa** reveals the 10th Lord Mars is in its Own Sign (Aries) in the wealth house, confirming that your inner professional value allows you to command this raise despite organizational resistance.

**Action:** Initiate salary negotiations immediately after **April 2, 2026**, when the Jaimini Chara Dasha shifts to Capricorn, activating your 10th House of Career.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Wealth Cluster" Activation:** You have a rare 4-planet conjunction (Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, Rahu) in your 2nd House (Leo). The current Dasha activates this entire cluster, making 2026 a pivotal year for income re-baselining.
*   **The Indu Lagna Trigger:** Transiting Saturn is currently in Pisces, moving directly over your **Indu Lagna** (the specific point of wealth). In Vedic astrology, Saturn transiting the Indu Lagna is a primary signal for a status change in earnings.
*   **The Jaimini/Yogini Confirmation:** The shift from **Aquarius Chara Dasha** (containing your Career Planet, Mercury) to **Capricorn** in April 2026, combined with the **Siddha (Venus) Yogini** phase starting in July, confirms a transition from "planning" to "receiving" rewards.
*   **D9 Strength:** Your 10th Lord (Mars) moves from a congested 2nd house in D1 to a powerful, independent position in the D9 2nd house (Aries). This means the raise is "earned" through your specific technical or leadership competence.

### Astrological Analysis

#### 1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)
Your chart is defined by the massive energy in **Leo (2nd House of Income)**. Here, the **10th Lord (Mars)** joins the **9th Lord (Jupiter)** and the **11th Lord (Venus's friend Saturn)**.
*   **Dhana Yoga:** The connection of the 2nd, 9th, and 10th lords creates a massive wealth yoga.
*   **The Challenge:** <term id="graha_yuddha">Graha Yuddha</term> (Planetary War) is active here. Mars defeats Saturn in war. This indicates that aggressive negotiation (Mars) will win over loyalty or waiting for tenure (Saturn). You must ask for the raise; it will not be given passively.

#### 2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)
You are in **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha**.
*   **Saturn** is in the 2nd House (Money).
*   **Rahu** is in the 2nd House (Money) and amplifies whatever it touches.
*   **Verdict:** This is the most financially "hungry" period of your life. Rahu creates a dissatisfaction with current earnings that drives you to seek more, and Saturn (Lord of the 7th/8th) ensures the structure changes.

#### 3. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Wealth)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of this financial gain:

*   **The "Techno-Commercial" Link (Saturn + Mars + Rahu):** Saturn (Karma) is conjunct Mars (Technology/Engineering) and Rahu (Expansion/Foreign). This suggests the salary hike is linked to **technical leadership, specialized engineering roles, or foreign/MNC clients**. It is not a general administrative raise.
*   **The "Jeeva-Karaka" Link (Jupiter + Saturn):** Jupiter (Self) is with Saturn (Work). This indicates your wealth comes from your personal reputation and advisory capacity. You are being paid for *wisdom/experience* (Jupiter), not just labor.

#### 4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **Lagna (Body):** The 2nd House (Wealth) is loaded with the 10th Lord. **Strong Promise.**
*   **Moon (Mind):** The 10th House from Moon (Libra) is aspected by the 10th Lord Mars. This shows mental focus on career status.
*   **Sun (Soul):** The 2nd House from Sun (Pisces) contains your Indu Lagna.
*   **Verdict:** Since this wealth focus appears in **3 out of 3 charts**, the confidence level is **95%** - the event is a major life milestone, not a minor adjustment.

#### 5. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
*   **Jaimini Chara Dasha:** On **April 2, 2026**, your major period shifts from **Aquarius** to **Capricorn**.
    *   Capricorn is the 7th house of business/contracts.
    *   Crucially, Capricorn Rashi aspects **Aries (your 10th House of Career)**.
    *   This aspect activates the 10th house, triggering the event.
*   **Yogini Dasha:** You are running **Bhadrika (Mercury)** Mahadasha. Mercury is your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (Career Planet). This is the "Career" dasha. The sub-period **Ulka (Saturn)** runs until July 2026. Saturn is in your wealth house.
*   **Synthesis:** The overlap of Chara Dasha change (April) and Yogini Saturn period (active now) pinpoints **Q2 2026** as the manifestation window.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your **10th Lord Mars** is in **Magha Nakshatra** (ruled by Ketu/Ancestors). Magha represents "The Throne."
*   This indicates that your salary hike is tied to a position of **authority or autonomy**. You are not just getting more money; you are likely stepping into a role that requires "sitting on the throne" (management or specialized command).
*   Since Ketu is in the 8th house, this raise might come through "hidden" sources—such as stock options, bonuses, or a restructuring that isn't immediately visible as base salary.

### Timing & Guidance
*   **Critical Window:** **April 2026 to July 2026**.
*   **Negotiation Strategy:** Use the **Mars strength**. Do not appeal to loyalty (Saturn). Appeal to your specific technical value and the revenue you generate (Mars/Jupiter).
*   **Remedy:** Since Rahu is in the 2nd house causing "smoke" or confusion regarding promised money, maintain absolute clarity in contracts. Do not accept verbal promises.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: The stars have aligned a "perfect storm" for wealth in your 2nd House. The Saturn-Rahu dasha creates the hunger, the Chara Dasha shift in April provides the trigger, and the Nadi links ensure the gain is substantial. Be aggressive in Q2 2026.</div>
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?

        
        Current question: "What does my birth chart say about my career? Currently employed, looking for salary hike"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge
        - D27 (Nakshatramsa): Strengths, weaknesses, general fortune
        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",

                }
            }
        }
