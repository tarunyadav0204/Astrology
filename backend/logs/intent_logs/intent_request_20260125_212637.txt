Q: Everything related to health
A: Tell me about my health over next 3 months.
Q: Tell me about my health over next 3 years.
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your health for the period of January to April 2026 requires **heightened vigilance and proactive management**, as several timing systems converge on your 8th house of chronic issues and "Mrityu Bhaga" (karmic landmines). According to **Jaimini Sutras**, you are navigating the **Aquarius Chara Mahadasha**, which corresponds to your natal 8th house, signifying a period of deep internal transformation and physical vulnerability. The presence of **Ketu on the Mrityu Bhaga** in this house suggests that traditional diagnosis may be difficult, or health issues may stem from "hidden" or systemic causes. However, because your 6th house (resistance) holds a powerful **34 Ashtakavarga points**, your body possesses a high capacity for recovery and "winning" over ailments once identified.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The 8th House Siege**: Your current <term id="dasha">Mahadasha</term> lord Saturn is the 8th lord (longevity/chronic issues) placed in a <term id="maraka">Maraka</term> (killer) 2nd house, signaling a phase where lifestyle discipline is non-negotiable.
• **Karmic Landmine**: Your natal **Ketu sits at 3.42° Aquarius**, within a 0.58° orb of the **Mrityu Bhaga (Death Degree)**. This indicates a "karmic wound" where Ketu cannot fully protect the 8th house significations, often manifesting as sudden, phantom-like symptoms or nerve-related sensitivity.
• **Jaimini Verdict**: Your **Arudha Lagna (AL)** is in Capricorn. The 2nd and 8th houses from AL are currently activated, which **Jataka Parijata** suggests can impact one's physical "vessel" and public vitality.
• **The Recovery Shield**: Despite the stressors, your **6th house (Sagittarius)** has **34 Sarvashtakavarga points**, indicating "Superior" support for overcoming illness and enemies of the body.

### Astrological Analysis
The next three months represent a transition from the "incubation" phase of health issues into a "confrontation" phase. Your natal **Cancer Lagna** is at **29.88° (Gandanta)**, which classical texts like **BPHS** describe as a critical junction of fire and water. This makes your physical constitution sensitive to environmental and emotional shifts.

#### The Parashari View
Your <term id="lagna">Lagna Lord</term> Moon is placed in the 4th house (Libra), which is generally favorable for emotional stability. However, the **Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter** <term id="vimshottari">Vimshottari</term> sequence is currently active. Saturn (8th Lord) and Rahu (placed in the 2nd) act as Maraka influences. The **Jupiter Pratyantardasha**, while a natural benefic, is the lord of your **6th house (diseases)** and sits in the **2nd house (Leo)**. According to **Phaladeepika**, the 6th lord in the 2nd can lead to health issues related to the face, throat, or diet-induced inflammation. 

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
The **Aquarius Chara Mahadasha** (Sign ID 10) is currently active. Based on the **Sign Aspects** mapping in your chart, Aquarius (10) aspects **Aries (0)**, **Cancer (3)**, and **Libra (6)**. This means your **1st House (Cancer)** and your **Lagna Lord (in Libra)** are under the direct influence of the 8th-house sign (Aquarius). 
- **Karkamsa Lagna**: Your soul's skill/talent point is in Sagittarius. 
- **Gulika Factor**: Natal <term id="gulika">Gulika</term> in the 11th house (Taurus) aspected by Saturn suggests that impurities or chronic toxins (Uric acid, blood impurities) could be the root of physical lethargy.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health)
Your chart reveals specific **Nadi connections** that define the nature of your physical experiences:
- **The "Karmic Weight" Link (Saturn + Mars + Rahu):** This connection in Leo (2nd house) indicates that your vitality is often drained by "internal heat" or inflammatory responses. It suggests a vulnerability to sudden spikes in blood pressure or acidic reactions.
- **The "Vitality Shield" (Jupiter + Sun):** A trine link between your Sun (in 9th) and Jupiter (in 2nd) provides "Divine Grace." This is why you recover quickly even when the dasha is difficult.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
This timing is confirmed by the **Aquarius Chara Dasha**, the **Ulka (Saturn) Yogini** (which classical texts associate with "Grief and Labor"), and your **Jupiter Pratyantardasha** in the 2nd house.
1. **Jan - Feb 2026**: Transition period. Focus on the stomach and respiratory system.
2. **March 2026**: High intensity. Transit **Saturn triggers your natal Sun** in the 9th house (Pisces). According to **Uttara Kalamrita**, this "Authority Transformation" can cause significant physical fatigue and bone/joint sensitivity.
3. **April 2026**: Shift into **Capricorn Chara Dasha**. Your **Muntha** enters the **1st House (Cancer)** for the new solar year, bringing the focus sharply onto "Self" and "Health."

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
- **From Lagna (Cancer)**: 8th house (Aquarius) is weak with **22 Ashtakavarga points**, indicating low protection against chronic stress.
- **From Moon (Libra)**: 6th house contains Sun and Indu Lagna, suggesting health is tied to your financial/professional stress levels.
- **From Sun (Pisces)**: The 12th house (Aquarius) contains Mercury and Ketu, warning against "invisible" ailments or poor sleep hygiene.
**Confidence Level**: Since health stressors appear in **3 out of 3 charts**, the confidence level for this warning is **99%**—physical discipline is mandatory.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D30 - Misfortunes)
In the **D30 (Trimsamsa)**, which specifically tracks diseases:
- Your **Lagna is Scorpio**, and **Mars (the lord) is in the 6th house (Aries)** in its own sign. This is a double-edged sword: you will face sudden inflammatory health "attacks," but you have the moolatrikona strength to fight them off.
- **Saturn is Exalted in the 12th house (D30)**: This suggests that "isolation" or "hospitalization" is actually a source of strength or necessary rest rather than a defeat.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your birth <term id="nakshatra">Nakshatra</term> is **Swati**, ruled by Rahu. Currently, **Saturn is transiting in Uttara Bhadrapada**, which is your **Vipat Tara** (Danger/Obstacles) from your birth Moon. **According to Phaladeepika**, a Vipat Tara transit by a malefic dasha lord creates "danger and obstacles" to physical well-being. This transit delivers its results through the 9th house (feet, thighs, and general fortune).

### Timing & Guidance
**NADI AGE TRIGGER**: Your current age (45-46) activates **Magha and Swati** nakshatras. Since you have a cluster of planets (Mars, Jupiter, Rahu) in **Magha**, this year is a "Karmic Destiny Trigger." These planets MUST manifest their results. With Jupiter (6th Lord) and Mars (5th/10th Lord) involved, your health is directly linked to your work-life balance.

**The Ashtakavarga Gatekeeper**:
- **8th House (Aquarius)**: The Ashtakavarga shows **22 points** for this house, indicating **weak** support. Do not ignore minor symptoms.
- **6th House (Sagittarius)**: The Ashtakavarga shows **34 points**, indicating **superior** recovery potential.

**Practical Remedies**:
1. **Strengthen the Moon**: Since your Lagna Lord is Moon, and you have **Mangal Dosha** from Lagna, practice "Sheetali Pranayama" to cool the internal heat triggered by the Mars-Rahu-Saturn cluster.
2. **Ketu Remedy**: Donate black and white blankets to the needy on Saturdays to mitigate the "Mrityu Bhaga" Ketu affliction in your 8th house.
3. **Dietary Discipline**: With the 2nd house (Leo) under heavy malefic influence, avoid spicy/acidic foods, especially during the **Mudda Dasha of Rahu** (starts April 11).

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your chart shows a "Fighter's Constitution." While the next three months bring a "Siege" to your 8th house, your high 6th-house Ashtakavarga points (34) ensure that you are the reinforcement that arrives to save the fortress. Manage your stress, and the body will follow.</div>
Q: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your health over the next three months (January–April 2026) requires **moderate to high vigilance**, as your chart enters a high-intensity karmic window. According to **Jaimini Sutras**, you are running the **Aquarius Chara Mahadasha**, which activates your 8th house of chronic issues and sudden physical shifts. This is compounded by the **Ulka (Saturn) Yogini Antardasha**, a period classical texts describe as bringing "fear and labor." While your overall vitality remains protected by your Lagna Lord Moon in the 4th house, the convergence of the **6th house Muntha** and **Saturn in Vipat Tara** suggests that digestive issues, inflammatory stress, or dental/eye sensitivity (2nd house focus) will be the primary "theatres of karma." Recovery is strongly supported by high <term id="ashtakavarga">Ashtakavarga</term> points in your 6th house, indicating you will overcome any obstacles through disciplined treatment.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your **Atmakaraka Saturn** sits in the 2nd house with Rahu and the 6th lord Jupiter. This indicates that your "Soul's Lesson" is currently tied to physical discipline and regulating your intake/speech.
• **Nadi Age Trigger**: You are approaching age 46, which triggers the **Swati and Magha Nakshatras**. Since your Lagna Lord Moon is in Swati and a cluster of planets (Mars, Jupiter, Rahu) is in Magha, this is a **Destiny Pivot Year** where your physical body undergoes a significant "reset."
• **Classical Reference**: According to **Phaladeepika**, the transit of a Dasha lord through a <term id="tara">Vipat Tara</term> (Danger) indicates a period where minor health issues can become exhausting if ignored.

### Astrological Analysis
The current alignment shows a transition from "managing" to "transforming" your health. The presence of your Mahadasha, Antardasha, and Pratyantardasha lords (Saturn, Rahu, and Jupiter) all within the 2nd house creates a "congestion" of energy in the Leo sign, affecting the upper part of the body and the digestive fire.

#### The Parashari View
According to **BPHS**, your Lagna Lord Moon is placed in the 4th house in Libra, which is a position of strength and emotional resilience. However, the next three months are dominated by the **Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter Vimshottari period**. Saturn is your 8th lord (longevity/chronic issues) and Jupiter is your 6th lord (disease). Their conjunction with Rahu in the 2nd house (Leo) suggests that the "seeds" of health issues are related to diet or internal heat. The **Ashtakavarga shows 25 points** for this 2nd house, indicating only moderate strength to resist these pressures.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
Jaimini Sutras state that the Sign-based Dasha reveals the "ground reality." You are in the **Aquarius Chara Mahadasha (Sign ID 10)**. Looking at the `sign_aspects`, Aquarius aspects Sign IDs 0, 3, and 6 (**Aries, Cancer, and Libra**). This means your **Lagna (Cancer)** and your **Lagna Lord (Libra)** are both under the direct influence of the 8th house sign. 
- Your **Atmakaraka (AK) is Saturn**, currently active in your timing. 
- Your **Gnatikaraka (GK - obstacles/disease) is Venus**, transiting your 11th house.
This synthesis suggests that while health challenges arise (GK/AK influence), they are "preventable" through social support or better routines (11th house Venus).

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your physical state:
- **The "Karmic Heat" Link (Mars + Rahu + Saturn):** This triple trine/conjunction suggests a tendency toward sudden inflammation or "Pittadosha" (heat-related issues). 
- **The "Guru-Chandala" Influence (Jupiter + Rahu):** This Nadi link indicates that unconventional treatments or a change in dietary philosophy will be more effective than standard medicine during this window.

#### Timing Synthesis
This timing is confirmed by your **Aquarius Chara Dasha** (8th house focus) and **Ulka (Saturn) Yogini**, which brings a "Sankata Vibe" of transformation. 
- **Vimshottari**: The **Jupiter Pratyantardasha**, sitting in your **2nd house**, brings 6th-house (disease) significations to this month. 
- **Varshphal**: Your **Muntha is in the 6th house**, focusing this year inescapably on health and debt management. The **Saturn Mudda Dasha** (from late 2025 into early 2026) acts as a restrictive filter, demanding you slow down.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
- **Lagna Chart**: Shows physical stress in the 2nd/8th axis (Leo/Aquarius).
- **Chandra Lagna**: From the Moon in Libra, the 6th house (Pisces) contains the Sun, indicating "Soul-level" vitality but potential for low immunity.
- **Surya Lagna**: From the Sun in Pisces, the 6th house (Leo) is heavily afflicted by Rahu/Saturn/Mars, confirming that the "battleground" for your health is currently your metabolic system.
**Verdict**: Since these health markers appear in **3 out of 3 charts**, the confidence level is **95%**—you must prioritize medical check-ups this quarter.

#### Special Points (Gandanta & MB)
- **KARMIC LANDMINE**: Your **Ketu at 3.42° Aquarius** falls on the **Mrityu Bhaga (Death Degree)** with a 0.58° orb. According to **Phaladeepika**, this "wounds" Ketu’s ability to protect the 8th house. Avoid extreme sports or high-risk physical activities during this window.
- **Gandanta Alert**: Your **Lagna (29.88° Cancer)** and **Mars (2.39° Leo)** are in the **Ashlesha-Magha Gandanta** (Junction Point). This creates "Extreme" intensity regarding your physical constitution; you may feel sudden energy drops or "voids" in vitality.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D30)
In the **D30 Trimsamsa** (the chart of misfortunes), **Saturn is Exalted in the 12th house**. According to **Uttara Kalamrita**, an exalted planet in a Dusthana in D30 indicates that while a "crisis" may occur, you have the "spiritual or structural armor" to survive it and emerge stronger.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your Birth Moon is in **Swati**, but **Saturn is currently transiting Uttara Bhadrapada**, which is your **Vipat (Danger) Tara**. This creates karmic obstacles in your recovery path. Furthermore, the **NADI AGE TRIGGER** for Age 46 activates **Magha**, which contains your natal Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu. This suggests a "Destined" shift in your health—likely a realization that old habits can no longer be sustained.

### Timing & Guidance
**February 2026**: High risk of inflammatory issues or stress-related digestion. 
**March 2026**: Focus on the eyes and throat; avoid over-straining your voice or vision.
**April 2026**: Nadi Age activation begins—the perfect time for a major lifestyle overhaul or starting a new health regime.

**Recommendations**:
- **Diet**: Reduce "Pitta" (spicy/acidic food) to calm the 2nd house Leo cluster.
- **Remedy**: Since your **Kota Paala is Rahu**, performing acts of charity on Saturdays (Saturn MD) will "guard the fortress" of your health.
- **Medical**: Schedule a routine check-up for teeth, eyes, and cholesterol, as the 2nd house rules these areas.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your chart is currently undergoing a "refining fire." While the aspects look high-pressure, the **34 bindus in your 6th house** provide an exceptional "shield" against permanent damage. Use this period not to fear illness, but to master your body's signals. As **Saravali** states, "The wise man uses the stars as a map, not a master."</div>
A: How will be my health over next 3 months.

        

KNOWN USER BACKGROUND:
- HEALTH: health
- CAREER: Employed

IMPORTANT: Do NOT ask for information already present in the user background.

        
        
        🚨🚨🚨 BLOCKING RULE - READ THIS FIRST 🚨🚨🚨
        Before generating ANY clarification question, you MUST:
        1. Read the "KNOWN USER BACKGROUND" section above
        2. Check if the information you want to ask is ALREADY THERE
        3. If it IS there, DO NOT ask for it - skip to asking about the specific aspect instead
        
        Example: User background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon as a Senior Software Development Manager"
        ❌ WRONG: "Are you currently employed or running a business?"
        ✅ CORRECT: "What specific aspect of your career would you like to explore - promotion timing, salary growth, job change, or career direction?"
        
        Current question: "Tell me about my health over next 3 months."
        
        CRITICAL FOLLOW-UP DETECTION:
        1. If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a FULL ANSWER (not a clarification question), and the current user message is:
           - A correction ("that's wrong", "incorrect", "planet position is wrong")
           - A follow-up ("tell me more", "what about...", "and...")
           - A clarification request ("what do you mean", "explain")
           - A short response referring to previous context ("yes", "no", "okay", single words)
           Then: Return status: "READY" immediately WITHOUT asking clarification. This is a continuation of the previous conversation.
        
        2. If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
           - Extract the area from the user's response
           - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
           - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)

        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge

        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. When clarification is needed, craft a natural, conversational question that:
           
           🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS check the KNOWN USER BACKGROUND section first.
           - DO NOT ask for information already present in the user background
           - Example: If background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon", skip asking about employment status
           - Example: If background shows "FAMILY: Married in 2020", skip asking about marital status
           
           Your clarification question should:
           - Focus on narrowing down the SPECIFIC aspect they want to know (timing, prospects, challenges, etc.)
           - Gather NEW factual information NOT in the user background
           - Sound warm, natural, and conversational (not templated)
           - Be tailored to their exact question
           - Help you provide a more accurate astrological analysis
           
           💡 FACT EXTRACTION BONUS:
           The MORE specific facts you can extract in your clarification question, the BETTER our future responses will be.
           - Instead of just asking "What aspect?", try to extract concrete details
           - Examples of valuable facts: specific job titles, company names, years of experience, number of children, ages, education levels, health conditions, locations, dates of major events
           - These facts will be stored and used to personalize ALL future astrological guidance for this user
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Questions involving 'when', 'growth', or 'timing' → ALWAYS set needs_transits: true
        - Career questions about promotions/hikes → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
