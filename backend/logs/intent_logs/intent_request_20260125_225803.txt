A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your 10th Board exam period is characterized by a "High-Pressure Brilliance." According to **Phaladeepika**, your <term id="lagna-lord">Lagna Lord</term> <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> is exceptionally strong in its <term id="own-sign">Own Sign</term> (Pisces) in the 4th house, forming a <term id="hamsa-yoga">Hamsa Yoga</term>, which guarantees a solid conceptual foundation. However, the current <term id="vimshottari">Vimshottari</term> sub-period of <term id="rahu">Rahu</term> in the 1st house, combined with <term id="saturn">Saturn's</term> transit over your natal Jupiter, creates a "Wisdom Through Hardship" scenario. You will likely achieve high marks, but the process will require more emotional resilience and structure than you initially expected. Jaimini's **Atma-Putra Yoga** (AK Mars + PK Mercury) confirms that your natural intelligence is top-tier; the challenge is solely managing the "Rahu-induced" anxiety.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The Exam Trigger**: Your <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> <term id="pratyantardasha">Pratyantardasha</term> (the 3rd-level dasha) activates the 11th house of gains, suggesting that the results of your hard work will be fulfilling and manifest as academic recognition.
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (<term id="moon">Moon</term>) is in the 3rd house of "Personal Effort." Success this year is not a gift of luck; it is a direct product of your manual notes and repetitive writing/practice.
• **Classical Authority**: According to **BPHS**, <term id="rahu">Rahu</term> in the <term id="lagna">Lagna</term> (Ascendant) during a <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> dasha creates a "Guru-Chandala" like effect in timing, which often leads to brilliant results but through unconventional study schedules or late-night bursts of energy.

### Astrological Analysis
The root of your academic success lies in the strength of the 4th house (Foundational Knowledge) and the 5th house (Intelligence). The <term id="sarvashtakavarga">Sarvashtakavarga</term> shows **30 points** for your 4th house (Pisces), indicating strong support for your school-level education and the ability to absorb complex information.

#### The Parashari View
Your chart features a powerful <term id="hamsa-yoga">Hamsa Yoga</term> because <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> is in its own sign in a <term id="kendra">Kendra</term>. According to **Saravali**, this makes the native wise, respected, and successful in learning. Your 5th lord (Intelligence), <term id="mars">Mars</term>, is placed in the 11th house, creating a <term id="dhana-yoga">Dhana Yoga</term> (Wealth/Gains of Knowledge). This means your "output" in the exam hall will be superior to your "input" during study. However, the 5th house itself has only **23 points** in Ashtakavarga, which is the "weakest sign" in your chart. This indicates that while you are smart, your concentration and memory retention might fluctuate—you must use visual aids and active recall to overcome this house's lower point count.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
From the perspective of your **Sagittarius Chara Antardasha**, your 4th house (Pisces) is activated because Sagittarius (ID 8) aspects Pisces (ID 11) according to **Jaimini Sutras** (ID 8 aspects 2, 5, 11). This double-activates your education sector. Furthermore, you possess a **Jaimini Raj Yoga** (AK Mars + AmK Moon) and an **Atma-Putra Yoga** (AK Mars + PK Mercury). The connection between your Soul planet (<term id="atmakaraka">Atmakaraka</term>) and the planet of children/intelligence (<term id="putrakaraka">Putrakaraka</term>) indicates a "Creative Genius." You won't just pass; you will likely solve the most difficult problems on the paper that others struggle with.

#### Nadi Precision
Your chart reveals a significant **Nadi Link** between **Saturn and Jupiter**. This is the "Dharma-Karma" link. It suggests that your "Karma" (Saturn/Exams) is deeply tied to your "Dharma" (Jupiter/Learning). You cannot cut corners.
- **The "Technical Master" Link (Saturn + Mercury):** This Nadi connection (Saturn in 10th trine to Mercury in 11th) specifically indicates a talent for Mathematics, Logic, and structured subjects. Use this to your advantage in science and math papers.

#### Timing Synthesis
This period is the "Master Clock" of your academic life:
1.  **Vimshottari:** You are in **Jupiter-Rahu-Mercury**. The **Mercury Pratyantardasha**, sitting in your **11th house**, brings the exact analytical edge needed for the next 3 months.
2.  **Chara Dasha:** Running **Libra-Sagittarius**. Sagittarius AD activates the 4th house of school exams.
3.  **Yogini Dasha:** You are in **Siddha-Siddha** (Venus). **Siddha** means "Accomplished." This is the highest-vibe Yogini dasha, signifying luxury, knowledge, and success.
4.  **Varshphal (The Annual Focus):** Your **Muntha** is in the **4th house** (Pisces). According to **Tajika Neelakanthi**, Muntha in the 4th house focuses the entire year's energy on your studies and domestic environment. You are "in the zone."

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
- **Lagna (Physical):** Jupiter in 4th—Great for absorbing knowledge.
- **Chandra Lagna (Mental):** 4th house (Taurus) has 33 points—Mentally, you feel prepared and stable.
- **Surya Lagna (Soul):** 4th house (Capricorn) has 27 points—Your soul's authority is tested by hard work (Saturn's sign).
**Verdict:** Since this strength appears in **2 out of 3 charts** (Lagna and Moon), the confidence level is **66%**—expect a very strong performance, though the physical body (Lagna) may feel the fatigue of the Saturn transit.

#### Special Points (Gandanta & Rahu/Ketu)
**KARMIC LANDMINE:** Your **Rahu** and **Ketu** are both on the **Mrityu Bhaga** (Death Degree) at 12.2° with a 0.8° orb. While this does not mean physical death, it means these planets are "wounded." Since Rahu is in your 1st house (Self), this creates sudden "mental fog" or an "imposter syndrome" where you feel you aren't prepared even when you are. Do not let these sudden waves of doubt derail your study schedule.

### Nakshatra Insights
You were born under **Purva Bhadrapada**, ruled by Jupiter. This nakshatra is associated with "The Front of a Funeral Cot," symbolizing transformation and intense discipline. Currently, **Saturn** is transiting **Uttara Bhadrapada**, which is your **Vipat Tara** (Danger/Obstacle). **Saturn is transiting in Uttara Bhadrapada, which is your Vipat Tara from your birth Moon in Shatabhisha. This creates danger and obstacles.** This is the "hardship" part of your "Wisdom through Hardship" trigger—expect minor health delays or technical glitches with your computer/study materials.

### Timing & Guidance
• **Fated Milestone (Bhrigu Bindu):** Your Destiny Point is in **Capricorn (House 2)**. Since your board results involve your "Status" (House 2/10), and the BB lord is Saturn, your result is fated to be a "Structural Pivot" for your future stream selection.
• **NADI AGE TRIGGER:** Age 16 activates the **Rohini** nakshatra. If you have any plans for higher competitions, the seeds are being sown now.

**Remedies & Actions:**
1.  **Mercury Strengthening:** Since Mercury is your Exam PD lord, wear green, use green ink for your rough notes, and chant "Om Budhaya Namaha" on Wednesdays to clear the Mrityu Bhaga "fog."
2.  **Saturn Appeasement:** To manage the Vipat Tara transit, help someone with their studies who is less fortunate than you. This "Dharma" will protect your "Karma."

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your chart shows a student who is "internally a scholar" but "externally a warrior." With the **Hamsa Yoga** and the **Siddha Yogini** dasha, you are destined for a top-tier result. Do not let the Rahu-Saturn pressure trick you into thinking you are failing. The "hardship" is merely the friction that creates the diamond. **According to Phaladeepika, a strong Jupiter in the 4th house ensures that the native's knowledge remains permanent and useful throughout life.**</div>
Q: Tell me about my studies in next 3 months. Will I do good, I am preparing for 10th Board exams.
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your 10th Board exam preparation is entering a high-impact phase where your innate intelligence is fortified by divine grace, yet tested by a demand for extreme discipline. According to **Phaladeepika**, your <term id="lagna-lord">Lagna Lord</term> <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> is exceptionally strong in its <term id="own-sign">Own Sign</term> (Pisces) in the 4th house, forming a <term id="hamsa-yoga">Hamsa Yoga</term> which provides deep conceptual understanding. However, the next three months (Jan-March 2026) are dominated by a **Saturn-Jupiter Karmic Trigger**, meaning "Success through Structured Hardship." You will perform well, but you must overcome a tendency for mental distraction caused by <term id="rahu">Rahu</term>'s presence in your <term id="lagna">Lagna</term>. The Jaimini Arudha status is strong, indicating your reputation among peers will rise significantly following these results.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (<term id="moon">Moon</term>) is involved in a high-strength **Jaimini Raj Yoga** with your <term id="atmakaraka">Atmakaraka</term> (<term id="mars">Mars</term>), ensuring that your career path (starting with these boards) has the "Soul-Power" to reach high authority levels.
• **Academic Convergence**: The <term id="varshphal">Varshphal</term> places your **Muntha** in the 4th house (Education) for 2026, making this the inescapable focal point of your destiny this year.
• **Classical Verdict**: According to **BPHS**, a benefic <term id="mahadasha">Mahadasha</term> lord (Jupiter) in a <term id="kendra">Kendra</term> ensures that despite obstacles, the "Fruit" of your efforts will be sweet and enduring.

### Astrological Analysis
The fundamental strength of your academic potential lies in the 4th house of basic education. With 30 <term id="ashtakavarga">Ashtakavarga</term> points, this house shows robust support for learning. However, the 5th house of "Exam Performance" (Aries) holds only 23 points, indicating that your biggest challenge is not *knowing* the material, but *delivering* it under pressure without making "silly mistakes."

#### The Parashari View
Your 5th lord <term id="mars">Mars</term> is placed in the 11th house of gains, conjunct <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> and <term id="venus">Venus</term>. This creates a powerful **Kendra-Trikona Raj Yoga**. According to **Saravali**, this combination indicates a sharp, analytical mind capable of handling complex scientific or mathematical data. However, <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> (significator of logic) is <term id="combust">Combust</term>, suggesting you may feel mentally exhausted or "burnt out" as the exams approach in March.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
Your current **Sagittarius Chara Antardasha** (Sign ID 8) is highly significant. According to the **Jaimini Sutras**, this sign aspects Gemini (ID 2), Virgo (ID 5), and Pisces (ID 11). This activation of **Pisces** (your 4th house) brings your <term id="darakaraka">Darakaraka</term> (Jupiter) into play, providing the wisdom of a mentor. Since your **Amatyakaraka Lagna** is Aquarius, the current period falls in the 11th house from it, promising gains through intelligence.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Studies)
Your chart reveals a specific **Nadi Link** between <term id="saturn">Saturn</term> and <term id="mercury">Mercury</term>/<term id="mars">Mars</term>. This indicates that your "Karma" in education is linked to **Technical or Logical mastery**. You are likely better at subjects requiring rules and structures (Maths/Science) rather than abstract arts. The <term id="saturn">Saturn</term> influence demands "Rote Memorization" and repetitive practice this month to overcome the <term id="rahu">Rahu</term> confusion in your 1st house.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
The timing for your Board Exams is precisely mapped across three systems:
1. **Vimshottari**: You are in **Jupiter-Rahu-Mercury** until Feb 2026. The <term id="pratyantardasha">Pratyantardasha</term> lord **Mercury** sits in your 11th house, bringing networking and intellectual gains. The transition to **Ketu PD** in March requires caution against "over-confidence" or technical glitches with exam tools.
2. **Chara Dasha**: The **Sagittarius** sign (ID 8) is active, which houses your natal <term id="rahu">Rahu</term>. This confirms a high-pressure environment where you feel the weight of expectations.
3. **Yogini**: You are in **Siddha** (<term id="venus">Venus</term>) dasha. As per **Phaladeepika**, the Siddha period is the "Giver of Accomplishments," specifically in the realms of knowledge and luxury. This is your primary "Success Shield."

#### The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
- **Lagna Chart**: Focus is on the 4th house (Deep Study).
- **Chandra Lagna**: The 10th house from Moon contains <term id="saturn">Saturn</term>, indicating a "Professional" approach to your revision is required.
- **Surya Lagna**: The 5th house from Sun contains <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term>, providing the "Soul's Confidence" that you will eventually succeed.
Since the focus on education appears in 3 out of 3 charts, the confidence level for academic success is **99%**—provided the work is put in.

#### Special Points (Gandanta & Yogi)
Your **Yogi Point** lord is the <term id="sun">Sun</term>, located in your 11th house. This means your "Fortune" in exams comes through your ability to stay visible and authoritative in your answers. However, your **Avayogi** (Obstacle Point) lord is <term id="saturn">Saturn</term>. This confirms that **laziness or procrastination** is your only true enemy over the next 90 days.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your birth <term id="nakshatra">Nakshatra</term> is **Purva Bhadrapada**, ruled by <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term>. This makes you a "Transformative Learner." You have the ability to go from zero to mastery very quickly. However, **Saturn is currently transiting Uttara Bhadrapada**, which is your **Vipat (Danger) Tara**. This creates karmic obstacles; expect minor delays or health-related lethargy in February. You must maintain a strict sleep schedule to mitigate this "Vipat" influence.

### Timing & Guidance
**Phase 1: Jan 25 - Feb 3 (Mudda Rahu)**
Confusion and high pressure. The **Ashtakavarga** shows 34 points for your 1st house (Sagittarius), giving you the physical stamina to study long hours, but Rahu may scatter your focus. Avoid starting entirely new topics; consolidate what you know.

**Phase 2: Feb 4 - March 24 (Mudda Jupiter)**
**Peak Performance Window.** As you enter the **Jupiter Mudda Dasha**, the "Hamsa Yoga" in your natal chart fully activates. This is the period of maximum clarity. Your **Sudarshana Year-Clock** is in the 5th house (Intelligence), making this the perfect time for mock tests.

**Phase 3: The Board Exam Month (March)**
**Karmic Trigger Alert**: Transit <term id="saturn">Saturn</term> is exactly hitting your natal <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> in your 4th house. This is "Wisdom through Hardship." The exams will feel "tough" or "lengthy," but your preparation will carry you through. The **Sarvashtakavarga** for Pisces is a healthy 30 points, providing a solid foundation.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are currently a "Warrior-Scholar." While the <term id="rahu">Rahu</term> <term id="antardasha">Antardasha</term> creates smoke and mirrors, the underlying **Jupiter Mahadasha** is a rock-solid foundation of success. Trust your memory, respect the discipline of <term id="saturn">Saturn</term>, and the Jaimini Raj Yoga in your chart will manifest as a stellar result. As the **Saravali** states, "One with Jupiter in a quadrant (Kendra) becomes a protector of his kin and a master of sciences."</div>

        
        
        
        🚨🚨🚨 BLOCKING RULE - READ THIS FIRST 🚨🚨🚨
        Before generating ANY clarification question, you MUST:
        1. Read the "KNOWN USER BACKGROUND" section above
        2. Check if the information you want to ask is ALREADY THERE
        3. If it IS there, DO NOT ask for it - skip to asking about the specific aspect instead
        
        Example: User background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon as a Senior Software Development Manager"
        ❌ WRONG: "Are you currently employed or running a business?"
        ✅ CORRECT: "What specific aspect of your career would you like to explore - promotion timing, salary growth, job change, or career direction?"
        
        Current question: "Tell me about my studies in next 3 months. Will I do good, I am preparing for 10th Board exams."
        
        CRITICAL FOLLOW-UP DETECTION:
        1. If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a FULL ANSWER (not a clarification question), and the current user message is:
           - A correction ("that's wrong", "incorrect", "planet position is wrong")
           - A follow-up ("tell me more", "what about...", "and...")
           - A clarification request ("what do you mean", "explain")
           - A short response referring to previous context ("yes", "no", "okay", single words)
           Then: Return status: "READY" immediately WITHOUT asking clarification. This is a continuation of the previous conversation.
        
        2. If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
           - Extract the area from the user's response
           - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
           - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge
        - D27 (Nakshatramsa): Strengths, weaknesses, general fortune
        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. When clarification is needed, craft a natural, conversational question that:
           
           🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS check the KNOWN USER BACKGROUND section first.
           - DO NOT ask for information already present in the user background
           - Example: If background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon", skip asking about employment status
           - Example: If background shows "FAMILY: Married in 2020", skip asking about marital status
           
           Your clarification question should:
           - Focus on narrowing down the SPECIFIC aspect they want to know (timing, prospects, challenges, etc.)
           - Gather NEW factual information NOT in the user background
           - Sound warm, natural, and conversational (not templated)
           - Be tailored to their exact question
           - Help you provide a more accurate astrological analysis
           
           💡 FACT EXTRACTION BONUS:
           The MORE specific facts you can extract in your clarification question, the BETTER our future responses will be.
           - Instead of just asking "What aspect?", try to extract concrete details
           - Examples of valuable facts: specific job titles, company names, years of experience, number of children, ages, education levels, health conditions, locations, dates of major events
           - These facts will be stored and used to personalize ALL future astrological guidance for this user
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Questions involving 'when', 'growth', or 'timing' → ALWAYS set needs_transits: true
        - Career questions about promotions/hikes → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},

                }
            }
        }

        EXAMPLES (use these to identify similar patterns):
        
        Question: "How is my 2026?"
        Response: {"status": "CLARIFY", "clarification_question": "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on?", "mode": "annual", "year": 2026}
