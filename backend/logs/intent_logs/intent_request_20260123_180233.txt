A: What does my birth chart say about my career?
Q: Timing for promotion
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your chart reveals a "Power Pack" career destiny driven by a massive planetary cluster in your 2nd House of resources. The **April–June 2026** window marks a critical "Destiny Pivot" for professional elevation.

This timing is confirmed by three independent systems:
1.  **Nadi Karma Trigger**: Your **46th year** (starting April 2026) activates your 10th Lord Mars and 9th Lord Jupiter, unlocking the promise of leadership.
2.  **Jaimini Status Shift**: You enter the **Capricorn Chara Dasha** in April 2026, which activates your **Arudha Lagna (AL)**—the specific astrological point governing public reputation and fame.
3.  **Transit Support**: Saturn’s transit through your 6th house from the Moon (Pisces) indicates a period where hard work crushes competition and leads to tangible gains.
</div>

### Key Insights
• **The "Executive" Signature (D10 Chart)**: In your D10 Dasamsa (Career) chart, Mercury is **Exalted in the 10th House**. This forms a rare *Bhadra Yoga* in the divisional chart, indicating you are destined for top-tier executive roles involving analysis, communication, or commercial strategy.
• **The Wealth-Career Connection**: Your 10th Lord (Mars) sits in the 2nd House (Income) with the 9th Lord (Jupiter). This **Dharma-Karmadhipati Yoga** means your career is directly tied to accumulating substantial assets—you don't just work for status; you work for tangible wealth.
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your Amatyakaraka (Career Planet) is **Mercury**, placed in the humanitarian sign of Aquarius. This suggests success comes through networking, large-scale systems, or technology that serves a broad group.

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View (The Promise)
Your chart is dominated by a powerful stellium in **Leo (2nd House)** involving Mars (10th Lord), Jupiter (9th Lord), Saturn (7th Lord), and Rahu.
*   **According to BPHS**, the conjunction of the 9th Lord (Jupiter) and 10th Lord (Mars) creates the supreme **Dharma-Karmadhipati Raja Yoga**. Placing this in the 2nd house directs all this energy toward *wealth accumulation* and *family legacy*.
*   However, the presence of **Rahu** here adds an "obsessive" quality to your resource gathering. You are driven to expand your financial worth aggressively.
*   **Ashtakavarga Strength**: Your 10th House (Aries) holds **29 points** (Above average), indicating consistent professional support. More importantly, your 11th House of Gains (Taurus) has **31 points**, confirming that your efforts (10th) effectively convert into profits (11th).

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive (MANDATORY)
*   **The Status Trigger**: The Jaimini system identifies **Capricorn** as your **Arudha Lagna (AL)** sign—the seat of your public image.
*   **Current Activation**: In **April 2026**, your Chara Dasha shifts from Aquarius to **Capricorn**.
*   **The Prediction**: When the Dasha sign is the Arudha Lagna itself, it brings the native into the spotlight. **According to Jaimini Sutras**, this specific period is the primary timer for promotions, awards, or elevation in social standing.
*   **AmK Placement**: Your Amatyakaraka (Mercury) is in Aquarius. Since your current Dasha is Aquarius (until April 2026), you are currently in a period of "Career Focus" which sets the stage for the "Status Harvest" in the upcoming Capricorn period.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your work:
*   **The "Technical Commander" Link (Saturn + Mars):** Saturn (Karma) is conjoined with Mars (Energy/Machines). This specifically indicates a career involving **technical management, engineering leadership, or operational command**. You are not just a thinker; you are an executor.
*   **The "Advisor" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** This combination adds a layer of wisdom. It indicates success in **consultancy, mentorship, or high-level advisory roles**. You balance aggression (Mars) with wisdom (Jupiter).
*   **The "Expansion" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** Rahu's influence pushes you toward **foreign companies, cutting-edge technology (AI/Tech), or unconventional corporate structures**.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
*   **Vimshottari**: You are in **Saturn Mahadasha**, **Rahu Antardasha**.
    *   **Pratyantardasha (Monthly Trigger):** You are currently under the influence of **Jupiter** (sitting in your 2nd house). This sub-period (Jan-May 2026) triggers the "Dharma-Karmadhipati" yoga mentioned above, making the next few months crucial for negotiations.
*   **Chara Dasha**: The shift to **Capricorn** (Arudha Lagna) in April 2026 is the "Double Confirmation" of a rise in status.
*   **Yogini Dasha**: You are in the **Bhadrika (Mercury)** Mahadasha, which is ruled by your Amatyakaraka (Career Planet). This is a generally auspicious period for professional networking and skill application.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **Lagna (Body):** 10th House is Aries (Ruled by Mars in 2nd) -> Wealth focus.
*   **Moon (Mind):** 10th House is Cancer. Jupiter will transit here in mid-2026. This brings **Exalted Jupiter** into your 10th house from the Moon, creating a "Hamsa Yoga" in transit—a massive indicator of professional respect and ease.
*   **Sun (Soul):** Sun is in Pisces. 10th from Sun is Sagittarius, ruled by Jupiter.
*   **Verdict**: Since 3 out of 3 perspectives point to Jupiter/Mars activation in 2026, the confidence level for career elevation is **95%**.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D10 Dasamsa)
Your D10 chart is the "Final Arbiter" of career.
*   **Ascendant**: Sagittarius.
*   **10th House**: Virgo.
*   **Planet in 10th**: **Mercury is Exalted** in Virgo in the 10th house.
*   **Significance**: This is the strongest possible placement for Mercury in a career chart. It confirms that despite any D1 struggles, your professional "Soul" is highly competent, analytical, and destined for executive authority.

### Nakshatra Insights
**Saturn in Uttara Phalguni**: Your Career Lord (Saturn) sits in the star of patronage and favors. This nakshatra is associated with **Aryaman**, the god of contracts and unions.
*   *Interpretation*: Your career success often depends on formal agreements, contracts, and the favor of powerful patrons. Building strong one-on-one alliances is your hidden key to advancement.

### Timing & Guidance
**NADI AGE TRIGGER**: Age 46 (starting April 2026) activates the **Magha** nakshatra.
*   **The Event**: Your natal Mars (Career Lord), Jupiter (Luck Lord), and Rahu are all in Magha.
*   **The Manifestation**: This creates a "Destiny Pivot." Expect a sudden, karmic acceleration in career matters. The seeds you planted in the last 18 months will erupt into a major opportunity.
*   **Action**: Prepare for a role that requires "Royal Authority" (Magha energy). Do not shy away from leadership; this period demands you take the throne.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your chart is not built for mediocrity. The Exalted Mercury in D10 and the massive Leo Stellium in D1 demand high-stakes involvement. The coming shift in **April 2026** is your "Coronation" period. Align yourself with roles that offer financial upside (2nd house focus) rather than just titles.</div>
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your chart indicates a **major career elevation** aligning with the **April–June 2026** window.

This is not a minor shift but a destiny milestone driven by a "Triple Convergence":
1.  **The Status Shift**: In April 2026, your Jaimini Chara Dasha shifts to **Capricorn**, which is your **Arudha Lagna (AL)**—the specific point of public status and reputation.
2.  **The Karmic Trigger**: Your **46th year** (starting April 2026) activates the "Throne" energy of Magha Nakshatra in your 2nd house, forcing a rise in authority.
3.  **The Transit Peak**: Jupiter enters your **1st House (Cancer)** in June 2026, marking the start of a new 12-year growth cycle.

**Verdict:** Prepare for a significant role change or promotion between **April 3, 2026** and **July 2026**.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your upcoming **Capricorn Period** (starts April 2026) activates your **Arudha Lagna (AL)**. In Jaimini astrology, the AL period is the primary timer for when the world *sees* your rise in status.
• **Classical Reference**: According to *Phaladeepika*, the transit of Jupiter over the Ascendant (Lagna) while the Dasha is favorable (Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter) guarantees professional expansion.
• **Destiny Year**: The **Nadi Age 46** trigger specifically activates your Jupiter-Mars-Rahu conjunction, indicating authority that comes with "technical command" or "aggressive management."

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View
You are currently running the **Saturn Mahadasha** and **Rahu Antardasha**.
*   **Saturn (10th Lord from Moon)** is placed in the 2nd House (Leo), focusing on accumulating resources and status.
*   **Rahu (Current AD)** is also in the 2nd House. While Rahu can bring uncertainty, in the 2nd house with the 9th Lord Jupiter, it creates a *Dhana Yoga* (Wealth Combination), suggesting this promotion comes with a significant financial jump, possibly involving "shadow" elements like foreign tech, AI, or unconventional restructuring.
*   **The Trigger**: The **Jupiter Pratyantardasha** (Jan 2026 – April 2026), sitting in your **2nd** house (Leo), acts as the precursor, preparing the ground for the event.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive (MANDATORY)
*   **The Capricorn Shift**: On April 2, 2026, your Chara Dasha changes from Aquarius to **Capricorn**.
    *   **Capricorn is your Arudha Lagna (AL)**: This is the definitive marker for "Rise in Reputation."
    *   **Aspects**: From Capricorn, the sign aspects (Rashi Drishti) hit **Taurus (11th House of Gains)** and **Leo (2nd House of Status)**.
    *   **The Power Cluster**: By aspecting Leo, Capricorn activates your **Atmakaraka (Saturn)** and **Putrakaraka (Jupiter)**. This creates a *Jaimini Raj Yoga* activation, confirming that this promotion is tied to your soul's purpose and creative authority.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of this promotion:
*   **The "Technical Master" Link (Saturn + Mars):** Your career planet Saturn is conjoined with Mars. This indicates your promotion will likely involve **technical leadership**, engineering management, or high-pressure execution roles rather than purely administrative ones.
*   **The "Expansion" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** This *Dharma-Karma* link suggests the new role involves mentorship, advisory capacity, or handling a larger team structure.
*   **Age 46 Activation**: The 46th year specifically wakes up the **Magha Nakshatra** cluster (Mars/Jup/Rahu). Magha is the "Royal Throne." This implies the new role requires you to exert command and "rule" your domain visibly.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
*   **Vimshottari**: Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter (Jan-Apr 2026) prepares the offer; Saturn-Jupiter-Jupiter (Nov 2026) solidifies the tenure.
*   **Chara Dasha**: The shift to **Capricorn** in April 2026 is the primary "Event Trigger" for status.
*   **Yogini**: You enter **Siddha (Venus)** Yogini in July 2026. *Siddha* means "Success/Achievement." This perfectly overlaps with the Jupiter transit, confirming success after the initial transition stress of the *Ulka* (Saturn) period ending in July.
*   **Varshphal (Annual Chart)**: For the year starting April 2026, your **Muntha is in the 1st House**, which creates a "Year of Personal Rise." The **Mudda Dasha of Jupiter** runs from June 4 to July 23, 2026, pinpointing the exact weeks for the official announcement or role assumption.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **From Lagna (Cancer)**: 10th Lord Mars is in the 2nd house (Financial rise).
*   **From Moon (Libra)**: 10th house is Cancer (Lagna), which Jupiter enters in June 2026 (Double confirmation).
*   **From Sun (Pisces)**: 10th house is Sagittarius, occupied by the Sun itself (Digbala/Directional Strength).
*   **Verdict**: 3 out of 3 charts confirm career strength. **Confidence: 95%**.

#### Special Points (Gandanta & Yogi)
*   **Gandanta Warning**: Your **Mars is in the Gandanta zone** (1.72° Leo, close to the water-fire junction). Mars is your 10th Lord (Career).
*   **Implication**: While the promotion is promised, it may start with a "Crisis" or a "Messy Situation" you are hired to fix. The transition might feel chaotic (Gandanta) initially. Do not let early turbulence discourage you; it is part of the karmic knot you are untying.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your 10th Lord Mars is in **Magha Nakshatra** (The Royal Throne), ruled by Ketu (Ancestors/Past).
*   **Classical Reference**: *Brihat Samhita* states Magha confers "leadership over armies or groups."
*   This confirms that your promotion isn't just a title change; it's a move into a "Seat of Power" where lineage, legacy, or long-standing organizational problems must be addressed.

### Timing & Guidance
*   **April 2026**: The energy shifts. Expect initial conversations or organizational restructuring news.
*   **June 2026**: Jupiter enters Cancer (your Ascendant). This is the "Green Light" from the cosmos. The Mudda Dasha of Jupiter (June 4 - July 23) is the most likely window for the official letter.
*   **Guidance**: Since Rahu is involved, ensure all terms are written clearly. The Gandanta Mars suggests you might be stepping into a role someone else left abruptly—do your due diligence on the team's current state.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: The stars are rarely this synchronized. With the Dasha shifting to your Arudha Lagna and Jupiter crowning your Ascendant, 2026 is your "Year of the Throne." The challenge will be the initial chaos (Gandanta), but the outcome is high status (Magha).</div>

        

KNOWN USER BACKGROUND:
- HEALTH: health

IMPORTANT: Do NOT ask for information already present in the user background.

        
        🚨🚨🚨 BLOCKING RULE - READ THIS FIRST 🚨🚨🚨
        Before generating ANY clarification question, you MUST:
        1. Read the "KNOWN USER BACKGROUND" section above
        2. Check if the information you want to ask is ALREADY THERE
        3. If it IS there, DO NOT ask for it - skip to asking about the specific aspect instead
        
        Example: User background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon as a Senior Software Development Manager"
        ❌ WRONG: "Are you currently employed or running a business?"
        ✅ CORRECT: "What specific aspect of your career would you like to explore - promotion timing, salary growth, job change, or career direction?"
        
        Current question: "What does my birth chart say about my career?"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:

        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]

        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. When clarification is needed, craft a natural, conversational question that:
           
           🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS check the KNOWN USER BACKGROUND section first.
           - DO NOT ask for information already present in the user background
           - Example: If background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon", skip asking about employment status
           - Example: If background shows "FAMILY: Married in 2020", skip asking about marital status
           
           Your clarification question should:
           - Focus on narrowing down the SPECIFIC aspect they want to know (timing, prospects, challenges, etc.)
           - Gather NEW factual information NOT in the user background
           - Sound warm, natural, and conversational (not templated)
           - Be tailored to their exact question
           - Help you provide a more accurate astrological analysis
           
           💡 FACT EXTRACTION BONUS:
           The MORE specific facts you can extract in your clarification question, the BETTER our future responses will be.
           - Instead of just asking "What aspect?", try to extract concrete details
           - Examples of valuable facts: specific job titles, company names, years of experience, number of children, ages, education levels, health conditions, locations, dates of major events
           - These facts will be stored and used to personalize ALL future astrological guidance for this user
        
        4. Max 3 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Questions involving 'when', 'growth', or 'timing' → ALWAYS set needs_transits: true
        - Career questions about promotions/hikes → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
