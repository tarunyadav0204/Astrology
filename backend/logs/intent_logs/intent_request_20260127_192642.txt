Previous conversation:
Q: Salary growth.
A: How is my relation with my sister.
Q: Career advancement
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your birth chart indicates a significant period of "Karmic Financial Restructuring." According to the **Jaimini Sutras**, your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (Career Significator) **Mercury** is placed in the 8th house of research and transformation, while your **Arudha Lagna** (Public Image) in Capricorn shows that your <term id="dhana-yoga-status">Dhana Yoga Status</term> is currently "Average" but building toward a peak. The presence of four planets—**Mars**, **Jupiter**, **Saturn**, and **Rahu**—in your 2nd house of <term id="dhana-bhava">Dhana Bhava</term> (Wealth) creates an intense pressure for salary growth, but also high volatility. The most significant jump in salary is likely to trigger after April 2026, when your **Chara Dasha** shifts to Capricorn, activating your <term id="arudha-lagna">Arudha Lagna</term>.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The 2nd House Powerhouse**: You have a cluster of planets in your 2nd house of wealth. This indicates that while your earning potential is massive, it requires disciplined management to prevent "leakage" through unexpected expenses.
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your <term id="wealth-from-al">Wealth from Arudha Lagna</term> shows that **Mercury** and **Ketu** are the primary source planets for your income. Since you work in **Astrology and AI Coding**, these planets perfectly represent "Occult Wisdom" (Ketu) and "Logic/Coding" (Mercury).
• **Classical Reference**: According to **Phaladeepika**, the 10th lord (Mars) sitting in the 2nd house (Wealth) ensures that the native's primary financial gains will always come from their own professional expertise and status.

### Astrological Analysis
Your chart shows a unique convergence between traditional wisdom and modern technology, which is the primary engine for your salary growth.

#### The Parashari View
In your <term id="rashi-chart">D1 Chart</term>, the 10th lord **Mars** is placed in the 2nd house of Leo. According to **BPHS**, this is a strong indicator of wealth through one's profession. However, because **Saturn** and **Rahu** are also there, your salary growth follows a "Step-Function" pattern—long plateaus followed by sudden, massive increases. Your 11th house of gains (Taurus) has a healthy 31 <term id="ashtakavarga">Ashtakavarga</term> points, providing excellent support for social networks to boost your income.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
From the perspective of **Jaimini Sutras**, your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> **Mercury** sits in Aquarius (the 8th house from Lagna). This placement suggests that your highest salary increases come when you master "hidden" or "complex" systems—like deep-level AI coding or predictive astrology. Your <term id="upapada-lagna">Upapada Lagna</term> is in Taurus, and its lord **Venus** is dignified in its own sign in the 11th house of gains, suggesting that financial stability is strongly supported by partnerships and long-term reputation.

#### Nadi Precision
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your wealth:
- **The "Tech-Guru" Link (Saturn + Jupiter + Rahu):** This triple conjunction in your 2nd house (Leo) indicates that your earnings are fundamentally tied to "Modernizing Ancient Knowledge." **Saturn** (Technical Master) + **Rahu** (AI/Foreign tech) + **Jupiter** (Astrology/Wisdom) creates a high-value niche.
- **The Mercury-Ketu Link:** As these are your wealth-source planets from the Arudha Lagna, it confirms that your "Salary" is not just for labor, but for your unique intellectual property in coding and data analysis.

#### Timing Synthesis
This timing is confirmed by the **Aquarius** <term id="chara-dasha">Chara Dasha</term> (running until April 2, 2026), your **Bhadrika** (Mercury) <term id="yogini-dasha">Yogini Mahadasha</term>, and your **Jupiter** <term id="pratyantardasha">Pratyantardasha</term> sitting in your **2nd house** of wealth. 
- **The Jupiter Pratyantardasha**, sitting in your 2nd house, brings a month of expansion and opportunities to negotiate your compensation.
- **Jaimini Sign Aspects:** Your current Aquarius Dasha (ID 10) aspects Sign IDs 0 (Aries), 3 (Cancer), and 6 (Libra) according to the `sign_aspects` mapping. This activates your 10th house of career (Aries), suggesting that career actions taken now directly impact your financial future.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
- **Lagna Chart:** 11th house of gains is Taurus, containing **Venus**, showing strong physical gains.
- **Chandra Lagna:** From the Moon in Libra, the 11th house is Leo, which contains your four-planet cluster. This means your "Mind" is constantly focused on maximizing these gains.
- **Surya Lagna:** From the Sun in Pisces, the 11th house is Capricorn, which is your **Arudha Lagna**. 
- **Confidence Level**: Since wealth indicators appear strong in 3 out of 3 charts, the confidence level for significant salary growth is 95%.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis
In the <term id="dasamsa">D10 Dasamsa</term> (Career Chart), **Mercury** is **Exalted** in the 10th house (Virgo). According to **Uttara Kalamrita**, an exalted planet in the 10th house of the D10 chart guarantees "Extraordinary Professional Status." This confirms that your salary is not just growing, but you are becoming an authority in your field.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your birth <term id="nakshatra">Nakshatra</term> is **Swati**, ruled by **Vayu** (the Wind God). According to **Saravali**, this gives you the "Pradhvamsa Shakti" or the power to scatter obstacles. 
**NADI AGE TRIGGER**: Age 46 (which you enter in April 2026) activates **Magha** nakshatra. Since you have a "Cluster" of **Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu** in Magha (2nd house), this year MUST manifest a "Major Life Pivot" in your finances. This is a destined karmic event.

### Timing & Guidance
Your **Varshphal** for 2026 shows your **Muntha** in the 1st house (Cancer), which is a "Kanak" (Golden) placement for health and personal growth. The **Mudda Dasha** of **Mars** starts on April 3, 2026, marking the exact window when your salary negotiations or AI projects will yield the highest returns.

**Actionable Advice:**
1. **Negotiate in April 2026:** The shift in Chara Dasha and the start of the Mars Mudda Dasha is your "Golden Window."
2. **Special Points**: Your **Yogi Point** is in **Virgo** (ruled by Mercury). Focus on your communication and coding skills to unlock your fortune.
3. **Caution**: With **Saturn in Vipat Tara** (Danger and Obstacles) transiting your 9th house, avoid conflicts with authority figures or mentors until June 2027.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your chart is a masterpiece of technical and spiritual integration. As stated in **BPHS**, "Wealth comes to those whose 2nd and 11th houses are supported by benefics." With your exalted Mercury in D10 and the upcoming Magha activation at age 46, you are moving from a phase of "Labor" into a phase of "Authority-based Earnings."</div>
Q: What are my health vulnerabilities?
A: I am not concerned about anything, I am healthy, just want to know how future looks like.

        

KNOWN USER BACKGROUND:
- CAREER: Work in Astrology and AI coding, Doing a lot of astrology and AI coding, Employed
- HEALTH: Health is a concern, health

IMPORTANT: Do NOT ask for information already present in the user background.

        
        
        🚨🚨🚨 BLOCKING RULE - READ THIS FIRST 🚨🚨🚨
        Before generating ANY clarification question, you MUST:
        1. Read the "KNOWN USER BACKGROUND" section above
        2. Check if the information you want to ask is ALREADY THERE
        3. If it IS there, DO NOT ask for it - skip to asking about the specific aspect instead
        
        Example: User background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon as a Senior Software Development Manager"
        ❌ WRONG: "Are you currently employed or running a business?"
        ✅ CORRECT: "What specific aspect of your career would you like to explore - promotion timing, salary growth, job change, or career direction?"
        
        Current question: "How is my relation with my sister."
        
        CRITICAL FOLLOW-UP DETECTION:
        1. If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a FULL ANSWER (not a clarification question), and the current user message is:
           - A correction ("that's wrong", "incorrect", "planet position is wrong")
           - A follow-up ("tell me more", "what about...", "and...")
           - A clarification request ("what do you mean", "explain")
           - A short response referring to previous context ("yes", "no", "okay", single words)
           Then: Return status: "READY" immediately WITHOUT asking clarification. This is a continuation of the previous conversation.
        
        2. If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
           - Extract the area from the user's response
           - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
           - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis

        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]

        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. When clarification is needed, craft a natural, conversational question that:
           
           🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS check the KNOWN USER BACKGROUND section first.
           - DO NOT ask for information already present in the user background
           - Example: If background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon", skip asking about employment status
           - Example: If background shows "FAMILY: Married in 2020", skip asking about marital status
           
           Your clarification question should:
           - Focus on narrowing down the SPECIFIC aspect they want to know (timing, prospects, challenges, etc.)
           - Gather NEW factual information NOT in the user background
           - Sound warm, natural, and conversational (not templated)
           - Be tailored to their exact question
           - Help you provide a more accurate astrological analysis
           
           💡 FACT EXTRACTION BONUS:
           The MORE specific facts you can extract in your clarification question, the BETTER our future responses will be.
           - Instead of just asking "What aspect?", try to extract concrete details
           - Examples of valuable facts: specific job titles, company names, years of experience, number of children, ages, education levels, health conditions, locations, dates of major events
           - These facts will be stored and used to personalize ALL future astrological guidance for this user
        
        4. 🚨 ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM: 1 clarification per conversation - NO EXCEPTIONS
           - After 1 clarification, you MUST return status: "READY" regardless of information completeness
           - The clarification_count parameter tracks how many you've already asked
           - If clarification_count >= 1, you are FORBIDDEN from asking another question
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Questions involving 'when', 'growth', or 'timing' → ALWAYS set needs_transits: true
        - Career questions about promotions/hikes → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
