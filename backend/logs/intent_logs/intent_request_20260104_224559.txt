Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **Saturn-Rahu period** (until Nov 2026) creates an intense "financial hunger" where your ambition for growth is high, but obstacles may feel heavy. **Specifically, expect a massive salary jump or lucrative role change between October 2026 and January 2027**, when Jupiter transits into Leo, triggering your powerful 4-planet wealth cluster. **However, your D9 Navamsa Mars in Aries** ensures you have the aggressive vitality needed to secure this deal—you are in a strong negotiating position. **Action**: Use the first half of 2026 to upskill; launch your bid for a raise/new role in Q3 2026.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Wealth Engine" (2nd House Cluster):** You have a rare and explosive combination of **Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Rahu** all sitting in your 2nd House (Leo). This indicates your financial life is not linear—it grows in massive, sudden spikes rather than slow increments.
*   **The "Gains" from the Mind (Moon Chart):** From your Moon Sign (Libra), this massive cluster sits in the **11th House of Gains**. This is a "Double Confirmation" that your primary source of mental satisfaction comes from seeing tangible financial results and network expansion.
*   **The Jaimini Confirmation:** The shift to **Capricorn Chara Dasha** in April 2026 is the turning point. Capricorn aspects Leo (your wealth sign), unlocking the financial promise held in your chart.

### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Dhana Yogas & The 2nd House)**
Your chart is dominated by the 2nd House of accumulated wealth (Leo). The presence of the <term id="yogakaraka">Yogakaraka</term> Mars (ruling Career/10th) combined with Jupiter (ruling Luck/9th) creates a powerful **Dharma-Karma Adhipati Yoga** right in the house of money.
*   **Result:** This guarantees that your career status (10th lord) is directly tied to your liquid wealth (2nd house). You are not meant for a fixed, stagnant salary; you are wired for high-value compensation structures (bonuses, stock, equity).

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari Dasha)**
You are currently in **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha** (Ends Nov 2026).
*   **The Conflict:** Saturn dictates discipline and delay, while Rahu demands shortcuts and sudden explosions. Since both are in your 2nd House (Salary), you are likely feeling "underpaid" relative to your effort, creating a psychological pressure cooker.
*   **The Release:** As this period concludes in late 2026 and transitions into **Saturn-Jupiter**, the "expansion" energy of Jupiter takes over, releasing the wealth that Saturn has been accumulating/delaying.

**3. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Your Wealth)**
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define *how* your salary growth manifests:

*   **The "Technical Commander" Link (Saturn + Mars):** Your career planet (Saturn) is conjoined with Mars. This indicates that your highest salary potential comes from **Technical Management, Engineering Leadership, or Strategy Execution**. You are paid for "Hard Skills" + "Authority."
*   **The "Foreign/Shadow" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** This connection strongly suggests that your best financial growth comes from **MNCs, foreign currency, or "Shadow" industries** (like backend tech, AI, or cybersecurity).
*   **The "Expansion" Link (Jupiter + Saturn):** Jupiter's influence on Saturn ensures that despite delays, your career trajectory is ultimately one of high respect and advisory capacity.

**4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
*   **Lagna (Body):** The 2nd house (Salary) contains the massive planetary cluster. **Verdict:** High potential, high expenditure.
*   **Moon (Mind):** The 11th house (Gains) contains the massive planetary cluster. **Verdict:** Exceptional desire for and realization of profits.
*   **Sun (Soul):** The 6th house (Service) contains the cluster. **Verdict:** Wealth comes through solving difficult problems, litigation, or overcoming competition.
*   **Confidence Score:** Since wealth indicators appear strongly in **3 out of 3** perspectives, the confidence level is **95%**—financial growth is inevitable, provided you navigate the Saturnian delays.

**5. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
*   **The Trigger:** The JSON data identifies a specific <term id="karmic_trigger">Karmic Trigger</term> starting **October 31, 2026**, where transiting Jupiter enters Leo.
*   **The Synthesis:** This transit touches your natal Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Rahu simultaneously. This is a "once-in-12-years" activation.
*   **Confirmation:** This timing aligns perfectly with the end of the stressful **Ulka Yogini** (Saturn) in July 2026 and the start of the auspicious **Siddha Yogini** (Venus).
*   **Prediction:** The period of **October 2026 to January 2027** is your "Golden Window" for a major salary renegotiation or job switch.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your **10th Lord Mars** is in **Magha Nakshatra** (ruled by Ketu/Ancestors). Magha represents "The Throne."
*   **Impact on Career:** You naturally seek authority and autonomy. You struggle in roles where you are micromanaged. To maximize salary, you must position yourself as an authority figure or a specialist who works independently.
*   **Advice:** In interviews, emphasize your ability to take ownership of projects (Magha energy) rather than just being a team player.

### Practical Guidance
1.  **Immediate (Now - July 2026):** This is the end of a "Karmic Squeeze." Do not rage-quit if you feel undervalued. Use this time to certify or upgrade technical skills (Saturn+Mars requirement).
2.  **The Strategy:** Your chart shows <term id="dharma_karma">Dharma-Karma Yoga</term> in the wealth house. Your salary growth is tied to *responsibility*. You cannot get a raise just for tenure; you get it for taking on a "burden" (Saturn) that others avoid.
3.  **Negotiation Window:** Schedule your performance reviews or job interviews for **September/October 2026**. The planetary wind will be at your back.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are sitting on a "volcano of wealth" in your 2nd house. While Saturn has likely kept a lid on it recently, the pressure is building for a release. The transition to Capricorn Chara Dasha and the Jupiter transit in late 2026 guarantees a significant level-up. Be patient, stay skilled, and prepare to strike in Q4 2026.</div>

Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?

        
        Current question: "What does my birth chart say about my career?"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge
        - D27 (Nakshatramsa): Strengths, weaknesses, general fortune
        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},
            "mode": "annual" or "birth",
            "category": "category_name",
            "year": SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION (only for annual mode),
            "needs_transits": true or false,
            "divisional_charts": ["D3", "D9", "D10"],
            "transit_request": {
                "startYear": SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION,
                "endYear": SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION,
                "yearMonthMap": {
                    "SPECIFIC_YEAR_FROM_QUESTION": ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
                }
            }
        }
