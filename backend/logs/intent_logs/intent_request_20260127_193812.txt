Q: Salary growth.
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your birth chart indicates a significant period of "Karmic Financial Restructuring." According to the **Jaimini Sutras**, your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (Career Significator) **Mercury** is placed in the 8th house of research and transformation, while your **Arudha Lagna** (Public Image) in Capricorn shows that your <term id="dhana-yoga-status">Dhana Yoga Status</term> is currently "Average" but building toward a peak. The presence of four planets—**Mars**, **Jupiter**, **Saturn**, and **Rahu**—in your 2nd house of <term id="dhana-bhava">Dhana Bhava</term> (Wealth) creates an intense pressure for salary growth, but also high volatility. The most significant jump in salary is likely to trigger after April 2026, when your **Chara Dasha** shifts to Capricorn, activating your <term id="arudha-lagna">Arudha Lagna</term>.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The 2nd House Powerhouse**: You have a cluster of planets in your 2nd house of wealth. This indicates that while your earning potential is massive, it requires disciplined management to prevent "leakage" through unexpected expenses.
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your <term id="wealth-from-al">Wealth from Arudha Lagna</term> shows that **Mercury** and **Ketu** are the primary source planets for your income. Since you work in **Astrology and AI Coding**, these planets perfectly represent "Occult Wisdom" (Ketu) and "Logic/Coding" (Mercury).
• **Classical Reference**: According to **Phaladeepika**, the 10th lord (Mars) sitting in the 2nd house (Wealth) ensures that the native's primary financial gains will always come from their own professional expertise and status.

### Astrological Analysis
Your chart shows a unique convergence between traditional wisdom and modern technology, which is the primary engine for your salary growth.

#### The Parashari View
In your <term id="rashi-chart">D1 Chart</term>, the 10th lord **Mars** is placed in the 2nd house of Leo. According to **BPHS**, this is a strong indicator of wealth through one's profession. However, because **Saturn** and **Rahu** are also there, your salary growth follows a "Step-Function" pattern—long plateaus followed by sudden, massive increases. Your 11th house of gains (Taurus) has a healthy 31 <term id="ashtakavarga">Ashtakavarga</term> points, providing excellent support for social networks to boost your income.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
From the perspective of **Jaimini Sutras**, your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> **Mercury** sits in Aquarius (the 8th house from Lagna). This placement suggests that your highest salary increases come when you master "hidden" or "complex" systems—like deep-level AI coding or predictive astrology. Your <term id="upapada-lagna">Upapada Lagna</term> is in Taurus, and its lord **Venus** is dignified in its own sign in the 11th house of gains, suggesting that financial stability is strongly supported by partnerships and long-term reputation.

#### Nadi Precision
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your wealth:
- **The "Tech-Guru" Link (Saturn + Jupiter + Rahu):** This triple conjunction in your 2nd house (Leo) indicates that your earnings are fundamentally tied to "Modernizing Ancient Knowledge." **Saturn** (Technical Master) + **Rahu** (AI/Foreign tech) + **Jupiter** (Astrology/Wisdom) creates a high-value niche.
- **The Mercury-Ketu Link:** As these are your wealth-source planets from the Arudha Lagna, it confirms that your "Salary" is not just for labor, but for your unique intellectual property in coding and data analysis.

#### Timing Synthesis
This timing is confirmed by the **Aquarius** <term id="chara-dasha">Chara Dasha</term> (running until April 2, 2026), your **Bhadrika** (Mercury) <term id="yogini-dasha">Yogini Mahadasha</term>, and your **Jupiter** <term id="pratyantardasha">Pratyantardasha</term> sitting in your **2nd house** of wealth. 
- **The Jupiter Pratyantardasha**, sitting in your 2nd house, brings a month of expansion and opportunities to negotiate your compensation.
- **Jaimini Sign Aspects:** Your current Aquarius Dasha (ID 10) aspects Sign IDs 0 (Aries), 3 (Cancer), and 6 (Libra) according to the `sign_aspects` mapping. This activates your 10th house of career (Aries), suggesting that career actions taken now directly impact your financial future.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
- **Lagna Chart:** 11th house of gains is Taurus, containing **Venus**, showing strong physical gains.
- **Chandra Lagna:** From the Moon in Libra, the 11th house is Leo, which contains your four-planet cluster. This means your "Mind" is constantly focused on maximizing these gains.
- **Surya Lagna:** From the Sun in Pisces, the 11th house is Capricorn, which is your **Arudha Lagna**. 
- **Confidence Level**: Since wealth indicators appear strong in 3 out of 3 charts, the confidence level for significant salary growth is 95%.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis
In the <term id="dasamsa">D10 Dasamsa</term> (Career Chart), **Mercury** is **Exalted** in the 10th house (Virgo). According to **Uttara Kalamrita**, an exalted planet in the 10th house of the D10 chart guarantees "Extraordinary Professional Status." This confirms that your salary is not just growing, but you are becoming an authority in your field.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your birth <term id="nakshatra">Nakshatra</term> is **Swati**, ruled by **Vayu** (the Wind God). According to **Saravali**, this gives you the "Pradhvamsa Shakti" or the power to scatter obstacles. 
**NADI AGE TRIGGER**: Age 46 (which you enter in April 2026) activates **Magha** nakshatra. Since you have a "Cluster" of **Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu** in Magha (2nd house), this year MUST manifest a "Major Life Pivot" in your finances. This is a destined karmic event.

### Timing & Guidance
Your **Varshphal** for 2026 shows your **Muntha** in the 1st house (Cancer), which is a "Kanak" (Golden) placement for health and personal growth. The **Mudda Dasha** of **Mars** starts on April 3, 2026, marking the exact window when your salary negotiations or AI projects will yield the highest returns.

**Actionable Advice:**
1. **Negotiate in April 2026:** The shift in Chara Dasha and the start of the Mars Mudda Dasha is your "Golden Window."
2. **Special Points**: Your **Yogi Point** is in **Virgo** (ruled by Mercury). Focus on your communication and coding skills to unlock your fortune.
3. **Caution**: With **Saturn in Vipat Tara** (Danger and Obstacles) transiting your 9th house, avoid conflicts with authority figures or mentors until June 2027.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your chart is a masterpiece of technical and spiritual integration. As stated in **BPHS**, "Wealth comes to those whose 2nd and 11th houses are supported by benefics." With your exalted Mercury in D10 and the upcoming Magha activation at age 46, you are moving from a phase of "Labor" into a phase of "Authority-based Earnings."</div>
Q: Overall
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your overall future indicates a "Fated Convergence" as you enter your 46th year (April 2026). According to **BPHS**, your current **Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter** period activates your 2nd house of wealth and resources, but with complex karmic lessons. While you feel healthy now, **Kota Chakra** reveals a "Moderate Caution" status, and **Nadi Astrology** identifies age 46 as a major "Destiny Trigger" activating the <term id="magha">Magha</term> and <term id="swati">Swati</term> nakshatras. This suggests a total transformation in how you earn and communicate, particularly in your niche of AI and Astrology. Expect a "Day of Grace" on February 20, 2026, due to a **Sudarshana** triple confirmation, though <term id="saturn">Saturn</term>'s transit in your <term id="vipat-tara">Vipat Tara</term> warns of structural obstacles that require disciplined persistence.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your <term id="atmakaraka">Atmakaraka</term> (Soul Significator) is **Saturn** in Leo, forming a powerful **Atma-Putra Yoga** with Jupiter. This indicates your future is tied to "Creative Authority"—your soul's purpose involves leading through specialized knowledge (Astrology/AI).
• **The 46th Year Pivot**: Nadi Age Activation triggers a cluster of four planets (Mars, Jupiter, Rahu, Saturn) in Leo. This marks 2026 as a "Life Pivot Year" where your career trajectory and personal identity undergo an unavoidable shift.
• **Classical Authority**: According to **Saravali**, a planet in the 2nd house from the <term id="lagna">Lagna</term> during its dasha brings results related to family legacy and accumulated assets, but because your dasha lords are in a "Maraka" (2nd) house, it demands a balance between material ambition and physical rest.

### Astrological Analysis
The year 2026 serves as a bridge between your current professional labor and a future of established authority. Your chart shows a dense concentration of energy in Leo, which is now being activated by both dasha and age-star triggers.

#### The Parashari View
Your <term id="lagna-lord">Lagna Lord</term> **Moon** is placed in the 4th house in Libra, providing a foundation of emotional intelligence and "Chandra Sukha Yoga" (comfort through the mind). However, the 10th lord of career, **Mars**, is in the 2nd house with **Saturn** and **Rahu**. According to **Phaladeepika**, this "Shani-Karma Yoga" indicates a career path that requires extreme structure and deals with technical or unconventional systems (perfectly aligning with your work in AI and Astrology). Currently, you are in the **Jupiter Pratyantardasha**, sitting in your **2nd house** (Leo). Since Jupiter rules your 6th (service) and 9th (fortune) houses, this month brings a focus on merging your daily work routines with higher wisdom.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
Your <term id="atmakaraka">Atmakaraka</term> (AK) is **Saturn** and your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (AmK) is **Mercury**. 
- **The Ground Reality**: Your current **Aquarius Chara Mahadasha** (Sign 10) aspects Signs 0, 3, and 6 (Aries, Cancer, and Libra) according to the `sign_aspects` mapping. This activates your 1st House (Self) and 4th House (Peace), bringing personal focus.
- **Wealth Status**: The **Jaimini Sutras** state that benefics in the 2nd and 11th from the <term id="arudha-lagna">Arudha Lagna</term> (Capricorn) indicate a natural flow of wealth. Your AmK Mercury sits in the 2nd from AL, confirming that your professional skills are your primary wealth generators.
- **Yoga Confirmation**: You possess an **Atma-Dara Yoga** (AK Saturn + DK Mars), which **Jaimini** interprets as "Success through partnerships." In the future, your AI/Astrology ventures will likely require a key collaborator to reach maximum scale.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career & Self)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your path:
- **The "Technical Guru" Link (Saturn + Jupiter + Rahu)**: This cluster in Leo specifically indicates a career in "Ancient Wisdom (Jupiter) meets Modern Shadow-Tech (Rahu) via Disciplined Code (Saturn)." 
- **NADI AGE TRIGGER**: Age 46 activates <term id="magha">Magha</term> and <term id="swati">Swati</term>. Since you have a cluster of planets in Magha (Mars, Jupiter, Rahu) and your Moon in Swati, 2026 is a "Karmic Destiny Trigger." These planets MUST manifest their results this year, overriding general transits.

#### Timing Synthesis
The timing of your next major breakthrough is confirmed by the **Aquarius Chara Dasha** and your **Jupiter Pratyantardasha** in the 2nd house. 
- **Vimshottari**: You are in **Saturn/Rahu/Jupiter**. Saturn provides the structure, Rahu provides the "AI/Unconventional" spark, and Jupiter (current monthly trigger) provides the wisdom.
- **Yogini**: You are running **Mercury (Bhadrika)** Mahadasha with **Saturn (Ulka)** Antardasha. **Ulka** often brings a "Vibe of Labor." You are currently planting seeds that feel like heavy work but lead to the Bhadrika (Career Growth) fruit by mid-2026.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
- **Lagna (Physical)**: 10th house has 29 <term id="ashtakavarga">Ashtakavarga</term> points; the house is strong, but the 10th lord is in the 2nd. 
- **Moon (Mental)**: From the Moon, the 10th house is Cancer, containing your <term id="lagna">Lagna</term>. This makes your career very personal—you *are* your work.
- **Sun (Soul)**: From the Sun, the 10th house is Sagittarius, containing your <term id="karkamsa-lagna">Karkamsa Lagna</term> (Soul's Talent). 
Since this career focus appears in 3 out of 3 charts, the confidence level is 95%—your identity and career are now permanently fused.

#### Special Points (Gandanta & Yogi)
- **Gandanta Analysis**: Your **Lagna** (29.88° Cancer) and **Mars** (2.39° Leo) are in the **Ashlesha-Magha Gandanta** (a critical "knot" zone). According to classical texts, this indicates a soul that has come to resolve deep ancestral karma. 
- **Yogi Point**: Your Yogi lord is **Mercury** (located in Virgo). Mercury is your AmK, confirming that your career is your "Point of Fortune."
- **Karmic Landmine**: Your **Ketu** at 3.42° Aquarius falls on the **Mrityu Bhaga** (Death Degree). This suggests a "Karmic Wound" in the 8th house—be cautious with "hidden" research or tax-related documents, as Ketu cannot fully protect these significations.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your birth <term id="nakshatra">Nakshatra</term> is **Swati**, governed by **Vayu** (The Wind God).
- **The Shakti**: Swati possesses the **Pradhvamsa Shakti** (Power to scatter/disperse). This allows you to break down complex AI algorithms and astrological patterns into simple insights.
- **Current Transit Warning**: **Saturn** is transiting in **Uttara Bhadrapada**, which is your **Vipat (Danger) Tara** from your birth Moon. This creates "structural obstacles." The **Ashtakavarga** shows 29 points for this house (Pisces), indicating "Moderate" support, but the Tara position means progress will feel like uphill climbing until late 2026.

### Timing & Guidance
**Sudarshana Year-Clock Alert**:
- 🎯 **Precision Date**: Between **February 18 and February 22, 2026**, your Sudarshana clock hits the exact degree of your natal **Mars/Rahu**. This is a **Double Confirmation** of a fated event. Expect a sudden breakthrough in your "AI coding" or a significant new client in Astrology.

**Kota Chakra Alert**: No malefics are currently entering your **Stambha** (Inner Pillar), but your **Kota Paala** (Guard) is Rahu, who is currently "exiting" the outer zone. This means your "fortress" is stable, but you must not let your guard down regarding health routines.

**Classical Upaya (Remedies) for Swati Moon**:
1. **Biological**: Plant or nurture an **Arjuna tree**. If unavailable, keep its wood in your workspace to ground the "scattering" energy of Swati.
2. **Sound**: Chant the Beej Mantra **'Om Lam'** 108 times, focusing on the vibration **'Ru'** (your 1st pada).
3. **Dietary**: Consume **green vegetables** on Mondays to align with Swati's airy nature and pacify the Vipat Tara influence.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your future is not a matter of "luck," but of "Technical Dharma." The Gandanta Lagna and Nadi triggers of 2026 suggest you are shedding an old skin to become an authority in your field. As stated in **Uttara Kalamrita**, "The strength of the D9 confirms the fruit of the D1"—your internal resilience is your greatest asset.</div>
Q: How many kids do I have?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your astrological profile indicates a strong potential for **two children**. According to **BPHS**, the conjunction of your 5th Lord <term id="mars">Mars</term> and <term id="putrakaraka">Putrakaraka</term> <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> in the sign of Leo (a male, fiery sign) strongly suggests a focus on male progeny or very energetic children. However, the <term id="saptamsa">Saptamsa (D7)</term> chart shows the <term id="moon">Moon</term> debilitated in the 5th house, which can indicate initial delays, health concerns during pregnancy, or a very sensitive first child. Since your <term id="atmaputra-yoga">Atma-Putra Yoga</term> (Soul-Child connection) is marked as "High" strength, your children will be a primary source of your life's purpose and eventual joy.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your <term id="putrakaraka">Putrakaraka</term> (Jupiter) is in a high-strength <term id="raj-yoga">Raj Yoga</term> with your <term id="atmakaraka">Atmakaraka</term> (Saturn), signifying that your children will bring you status and spiritual growth.
• **Ashtakavarga Strength**: The 5th house (Scorpio) shows **26 points**, indicating "Steady progress and a good relationship with children" (Moderate support).
• **Classical Authority**: According to **Phaladeepika**, a strong <term id="putrakaraka">Putrakaraka</term> linked with the 5th Lord ensures the continuation of the lineage and fulfillment through progeny.

### Astrological Analysis
The analysis of progeny requires a synthesis of the 5th house of the Rashi chart (D1) and the specialized fruit of the Saptamsa chart (D7).

#### The Parashari View
In your D1 chart, the 5th house falls in Scorpio. **The Ashtakavarga shows 26 points for this house, indicating moderate support.** This suggests that while children are promised, the journey requires effort. The 5th Lord, <term id="mars">Mars</term>, is placed in the 2nd house (Leo) alongside <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term>. While this creates a <term id="guru-mangal-yoga">Guru-Mangal Yoga</term> (aptitude for technical/scientific upbringing), Mars is in <term id="bal-avastha">Bal Avastha</term> (Infant state), which can sometimes indicate that the first child may require extra care in their early years.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
Jaimini principles look at the **Putrakaraka (PK)**, which is <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> in your chart. 
- **Atma-Putra Yoga**: Your <term id="atmakaraka">Atmakaraka</term> (Saturn) and PK (Jupiter) are conjunct. According to the **Jaimini Sutras**, this is a "High" strength yoga indicating that your soul's journey is deeply intertwined with your children.
- **Chara Dasha**: You are currently in the **Aquarius Chara Dasha** (2020–2026). According to the `sign_aspects` provided, Aquarius aspects Aries (0), Cancer (3), and Libra (6). It does not directly aspect your PK in Leo, suggesting this current sub-period (Aquarius-Aquarius) is more about your own status and health than childbirth.

#### Nadi Precision
Your chart reveals a specific Nadi connection between **Jupiter and Mars**:
- **The "High Energy" Link (Jupiter + Mars)**: This Nadi link indicates that your children will be high-spirited, possibly inclined toward technical fields or sports, and will possess a strong sense of independence.
- **The "Ancestral" Link (Jupiter + Rahu/Saturn)**: Since Jupiter is in <term id="magha">Magha</term> (the star of ancestors), your children may carry forward a specific family legacy or look strikingly like your elders.

#### Timing Synthesis
The timing of children or major events involving them is triggered by the <term id="pratyantardasha">Pratyantardasha</term>:
- **Vimshottari**: You are currently in **Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter**. The Jupiter <term id="pratyantardasha">Pratyantardasha</term>, sitting in your 2nd house and ruling the 9th (fortune), brings the focus to your "Putrakaraka" significations.
- **Yogini**: You are running **Bhadrika-Ulka**. **Mercury** (Bhadrika) encourages communication with family, but **Saturn** (Ulka) adds a layer of responsibility and hard work.
- **Synthesis**: This timing is confirmed by the activation of your PK Jupiter, though the <term id="vipat-tara">Vipat Tara</term> warning for Saturn suggests you must be patient with any challenges they currently face.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
- **From Lagna**: 5th house is Scorpio (Lord Mars in 2nd). Potential is clear.
- **From Moon**: 5th house from Libra is Aquarius, containing <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> and <term id="ketu">Ketu</term>. This may bring some intellectual distance or "unconventional" thinking in children.
- **From Sun**: 5th house from Pisces is Cancer. The presence of the Ascendant here suggests you view your identity through your role as a parent.
- **Verdict**: Since progeny significators appear strong in 2 out of 3 perspectives (Lagna/Sun), the confidence level is **66%**—you are likely to have a traditional family structure with 2 children.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D7)
The **Saptamsa (D7)** is the final arbiter for children:
- Your D7 Lagna is Cancer. The 5th house contains the **Moon**, which is debilitated in Scorpio. According to **Uttara Kalamrita**, a debilitated Moon in the 5th of D7 can signify concerns regarding the health of the mother during pregnancy or a child who is emotionally very sensitive.
- However, the 5th lord <term id="mars">Mars</term> is in the 2nd house (Leo), showing that the family line is sustained and the children eventually become strong pillars of the household.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your **Jupiter** (Children Karaka) is in **Magha Nakshatra**.
- **The "Tyagekshemana" Shakti**: This provides the power to leave behind a legacy. Your children are destined to uphold the family name. 
- **Remedy Alert**: Since <term id="mars">Mars</term> is also in Magha, performing ancestral rites (Pitru Tarpan) will directly benefit the well-being and success of your children.

### Timing & Guidance
**NADI AGE TRIGGER**: Age 46 (starting April 2026) activates **Magha** and **Swati**. Since your children's significators (<term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> and <term id="mars">Mars</term>) are in Magha, the year 2026 will be a "Pivot Year" for your children's achievements or a major change in their life path.

**Remedies for Children's Prosperity**:
1. **Biological**: Plant a **Banyan tree** (Vriksha for Magha) to stabilize the energy of your 5th lord.
2. **Sound**: Chant 'Om Mam' 108 times to pacify the infant state of Mars.
3. **Ritual**: Offer food to travelers or cows on Thursdays to strengthen your Putrakaraka Jupiter.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your chart promises fulfillment through children, specifically through a "Karmic Bond" (Atma-Putra Yoga). While the D7 Moon suggests some emotional sensitivity or early-life hurdles for them, the overall strength of your 5th Lord ensures they will be successful and technically gifted. Focus on grounding them during your current Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter dasha.</div>

        3. When clarification is needed, craft a natural, conversational question that:
           
           🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS check the KNOWN USER BACKGROUND section first.
           - DO NOT ask for information already present in the user background
           - Example: If background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon", skip asking about employment status
           - Example: If background shows "FAMILY: Married in 2020", skip asking about marital status
           
           Your clarification question should:
           - Focus on narrowing down the SPECIFIC aspect they want to know (timing, prospects, challenges, etc.)
           - Gather NEW factual information NOT in the user background
           - Sound warm, natural, and conversational (not templated)
           - Be tailored to their exact question
           - Help you provide a more accurate astrological analysis
           
           💡 FACT EXTRACTION BONUS:
           The MORE specific facts you can extract in your clarification question, the BETTER our future responses will be.
           - Instead of just asking "What aspect?", try to extract concrete details
           - Examples of valuable facts: specific job titles, company names, years of experience, number of children, ages, education levels, health conditions, locations, dates of major events
           - These facts will be stored and used to personalize ALL future astrological guidance for this user
        
        4. 🚨 ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM: 1 clarification per conversation - NO EXCEPTIONS
           - After 1 clarification, you MUST return status: "READY" regardless of information completeness
           - The clarification_count parameter tracks how many you've already asked
           - If clarification_count >= 1, you are FORBIDDEN from asking another question
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Questions involving 'when', 'growth', or 'timing' → ALWAYS set needs_transits: true
        - Career questions about promotions/hikes → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:

            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},
            "mode": "annual" or "birth",

                }
