================================================================================

        You are a clarification assistant for an astrology chatbot. Your job is to determine if a question is too vague and needs clarification.
        

Previous conversation:
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: What are my health vulnerabilities?
Q: I am employed in Amazon as a Senior Software Development Manager.
A: I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?
Q: Tell me about my career right now. What's going on.
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: You are currently in a high-intensity "Financial & Career Peak" phase. The concentration of four major planets (Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, Rahu) in your 2nd House of wealth and resources indicates that your role at Amazon is not just about code—it's about managing significant value, budgets, or team resources under high pressure.

This is a defining moment because your current **Aquarius Chara Dasha** contains your **Amatyakaraka (Career Planet) Mercury**, directly activating your professional rise. While the workload is heavy (Saturn influence), the alignment confirms high status and the potential for substantial financial restructuring or gains in 2026.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The Tech-Management Signature**: Your D10 (Career Chart) features an **Exalted Mercury** in the 10th house. This is the classic signature of a "Master Engineer" or high-level Tech Manager, perfectly matching your SDM role.
• **The "Pressure Cooker" Wealth Yoga**: In your main chart (D1), the cluster of Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu in the 2nd House creates a powerful engine for wealth generation, but it comes with the "Golden Handcuffs" effect—high rewards accompanied by relentless demand and complexity.
• **The Jaimini Confirmation**: **Aquarius Period (2025-2026)**. Since Aquarius holds your Amatyakaraka (Mercury), this specific year is marked as a "Career Milestone" in your timeline.

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View
Your 10th House (Career) is Aries, ruled by Mars. Mars sits in the 2nd House (Leo) alongside Saturn, Jupiter, and Rahu.
- **Resource Management**: The 10th Lord in the 2nd House links your career directly to "Assets" and "Speech." As an SDM, this implies your value comes from *orchestrating* resources (people/budgets) rather than just individual contribution.
- **The 4-Planet Conjunction**: This rare cluster in Leo creates a dynamic of "Controlled Chaos." Saturn brings structure, Rahu brings innovation (and anxiety), Mars brings drive, and Jupiter brings expansion. You are likely managing a team that is diverse, demanding, or undergoing significant restructuring.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive (MANDATORY)
- **Current Chara Dasha**: You are running the **Aquarius** Antardasha (Oct 2025 – Apr 2026).
- **The AmK Activation**: Aquarius contains your **Amatyakaraka (Mercury)**, the planet holding the portfolio of your Career.
- **The Aspect Mechanism**: From the Aquarius Dasha sign, Jaimini aspects hit **Aries (your 10th House of Career)** and **Cancer (your 1st House of Self)**.
- **Verdict**: This is a "Double Confirmation." The Dasha sign holds the Career Planet *and* aspects the Career House. This is often a time of promotion, role change, or maximum visibility.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your work at Amazon:

- **The "Technical Master" Link (Saturn + Mars):** Saturn (Karma) is conjoined with Mars (Engineering). In Nadi, this specifically indicates a career involving "machinery, logic, code, or technical infrastructure." It validates your Engineering Management role.
- **The "MNC/Shadow" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** Saturn's connection with Rahu indicates work with "Foreign things," "The Web," or "Massive Scale." This is the signature of Big Tech (Amazon) and dealing with global/distributed systems.
- **The "Advisor" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** This modifies the raw engineering energy into "Management." You are not just building; you are guiding (Jupiter) the work.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
1.  **Vimshottari (The Triple Trigger):** You are in **Saturn Mahadasha**, **Rahu Antardasha**, and **Jupiter Pratyantardasha**.
    - The **Jupiter Pratyantardasha**, sitting in your **2nd House**, brings a focus on financial expansion and team wisdom to this specific month. Because Jupiter is with Rahu, expect "unconventional" growth or organizational changes that seem chaotic but benefit you financially.
2.  **Chara:** The active **Aquarius** sign activates your **10th House (Aries)** via Rashi Drishti, confirming professional focus.
3.  **Yogini:** You are under the influence of **Ulka (Saturn)**. Ulka represents "Labor" and "Exertion." It confirms that while the rewards are high, the current vibe is one of heavy lifting and managing crises.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
- **Lagna (Body):** 10th House is Aries (Ruled by Mars in 2nd). Career is driven by ambition for resources.
- **Moon (Mind):** Moon is in Libra. 10th from Moon is **Cancer**. This puts your Lagna Lord (Moon) in the 4th from itself, suggesting career stress impacts work-life balance/home peace.
- **Sun (Soul):** Sun is in Pisces. 10th from Sun is **Sagittarius**. This is ruled by Jupiter (in the 2nd house cluster).
- **Verdict:** Since 2 out of 3 views point directly back to the 2nd House cluster (Leo), the "Wealth/Resource" theme is 80% dominant. Your soul and body agree: this job is about building a financial fortress.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D10 Dasamsa)
- **Ascendant:** Sagittarius.
- **10th House:** Virgo.
- **Planet in 10th:** **Mercury is Exalted in Virgo.**
- **Analysis:** This is the "Royal Seal" for a career in software/intellect. An exalted planet in the 10th house of the D10 chart creates a *Bhadra Yoga* equivalent in the career realm—unshakable professional competence. Rahu is also here, re-confirming the connection to cutting-edge technology and foreign corporations.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your Dasha Lord **Saturn** is in **Uttara Phalguni** (ruled by the Sun). The Sun represents Authority and Administration.
- **Insight:** You are moving from a phase of "Service" to "Sovereignty." Uttara Phalguni is the "Star of Patronage." Your role is evolving into one where you provide stability and patronage to others (your team), rather than just executing tasks.

### Timing & Guidance
**Current Transit Reality (2026):**
- **Jupiter in 12th House (Gemini):** The Ashtakavarga shows **35 points** (Exceptional). Even though the 12th house is usually "loss," 35 points here suggests massive success in "Backend Operations," "Remote Work," or "Foreign Projects." You might be managing things that are invisible to the public but critical to the infrastructure.
- **Rahu in 8th House (Aquarius):** The Ashtakavarga shows only **22 points** (Weak). Caution is needed. Rahu transiting the sign of your Career Planet (Mercury) in the 8th house can bring sudden, stressful changes or office politics.
- **Guidance:** Use the strength of Jupiter (Backend Success) to navigate the instability of Rahu (Transformation). Do not fear reorganization; your D10 strength protects you.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are in a "Power Year." The convergence of your Chara Dasha activating your Career Planet and the massive 2nd House energy suggests you are building a legacy of value. The stress (Ulka/Rahu) is the price of the high status (Exalted Mercury) you currently hold.</div>

        

KNOWN USER BACKGROUND:
- CAREER: Employed in Amazon as a Senior Software Development Manager

IMPORTANT: Do NOT ask for information already present in the user background.

        
        Current question: "What are my health vulnerabilities?"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices

        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Questions involving 'when', 'growth', or 'timing' → ALWAYS set needs_transits: true
        - Career questions about promotions/hikes → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",

                }
            }
        }
