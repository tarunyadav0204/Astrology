        You are a clarification assistant for an astrology chatbot. Your job is to determine if a question is too vague and needs clarification.
        

Previous conversation:
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career? I am employed and looking for salary hike.
A: salary growth.
Q: How will be my savings in 2026. I am never able to save anything even though I earn good.
A: I can help with that! What specifically would you like to know about your career - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?
Q: Why are you not including pratyantar dasha even though I told it is mandatory
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **January–July 2026** period continues the "high income, high expense" cycle due to your **Saturn-Rahu** dasha activating the massive planetary cluster in your 2nd House of Savings. Specifically, expect a major financial turning point around **July 6, 2026**, when your Yogini Dasha shifts to **Siddha (Venus)**. While your D9 Navamsa shows Mars in its own sign (Aries), indicating you have the inner grit to recover, you must enforce a strict "spending freeze" until mid-year. Focus on clearing debts now; accumulation begins after July.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The "Leaky Bucket" Paradox**: Your chart perfectly explains your dilemma. You have **Venus in the 11th House (Taurus)**, which guarantees excellent income ("earning good"). However, your **2nd House of Savings (Leo)** contains a chaotic 4-planet war (Saturn, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter). This acts like a furnace, burning money as soon as it arrives.
• **The Fractal Convergence**: Currently, your Mahadasha (Saturn), Antardasha (Rahu), and **Pratyantardasha (Jupiter)** are ALL sitting together in that same 2nd House. This triple activation of the "problem area" is why saving feels impossible right now.
• **The Jaimini Secret**: From **April 2026**, your Chara Dasha shifts to **Capricorn**. Your Amatyakaraka (Career Planet), Mercury, sits in the 2nd house from Capricorn. This signals that your professional decisions will finally start directly feeding your savings account.
• **July 2026 Breakthrough**: The shift from **Ulka (Saturn)** to **Siddha (Venus)** Yogini Dasha in July is the "release valve" you have been waiting for.

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View (The Root Cause)
Your financial reality is defined by a stark contrast between **Income (11th House)** and **Retention (2nd House)**.
*   **The Income Engine:** Venus, the planet of luxury and currency, is strong in its own sign (Taurus) in the 11th House. This ensures a steady, often high, inflow of cash.
*   **The Savings Drain:** The 2nd House (Leo) hosts a **Planetary War**.
    *   **Mars** causes impulsive spending on "emergencies."
    *   **Rahu** creates smoke-and-mirrors expenses (hidden costs, sudden repairs).
    *   **Saturn** causes delays and fear, making you feel "broke" even when you have money.
*   **The 2026 Trigger:** Since your current Dasha lords (Saturn and Rahu) are both stationed in this 2nd House, the "burning" effect is at its peak intensity.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
Your Jaimini chart confirms the timing of the turnaround:
*   **Wealth Verdict:** Your Arudha Lagna (AL) is Capricorn. The 2nd from AL is Aquarius, containing Mercury and Ketu. This indicates wealth comes through intelligence/coding/communication but is subject to fluctuations (Ketu).
*   **Chara Dasha Shift (April 2026):** You enter the **Capricorn** period.
    *   From Capricorn, your **Amatyakaraka (Mercury)** falls in the 2nd House.
    *   **Prediction:** This is a **Double Confirmation** that career status (AmK) will directly boost accumulated wealth (2nd House) starting in Q2 2026.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Wealth)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define your financial karma:
1.  **The "Shakti Yoga" Link (Saturn + Mars + Rahu):** This combination in your 2nd house suggests your money often goes toward **technical infrastructure, machinery, or sudden "breakdowns"**. It indicates that wealth accumulation requires "hard assets" (land/gold) rather than liquid cash, which tends to evaporate.
2.  **The "Dhana Yoga" Block (Jupiter + Saturn):** While Jupiter and Saturn together usually create stable wealth, the presence of Rahu amplifies the *desire* to spend on big, unconventional projects before the money is actually secured.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
The alignment of multiple timing systems points to **July 2026** as the pivot point:
*   **Vimshottari (The Master Clock):** You are in **Saturn-Rahu** until **November 2026**. This is the "storm."
    *   **The Monthly Trigger:** The **Jupiter Pratyantardasha** (Jan 01 - Mar 04, 2026), sitting in your 2nd House, amplifies the focus on family finances and savings pressure *right now*.
*   **Yogini (The Micro-Trigger):** You are currently in **Ulka (Saturn)**, which signifies labor and struggle. On **July 6, 2026**, you enter **Siddha (Venus)**.
    *   **Synthesis:** Since Venus is your strongest financial planet (11th Lord in 11th), this Yogini shift overrides the difficult Vimshottari energy.
*   **Varshphal (Annual Chart 2026):** Your **Muntha** is in the 1st House (Self), meaning you are personally responsible for the change. The **Mudda Dasha** of **Rahu (April-June)** mirrors the Vimshottari stress, but **Venus Mudda (Dec 2026)** ends the year on a high note.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **Lagna (Cancer):** 2nd House is Leo (Heavily Afflicted).
*   **Moon (Libra):** 2nd House is Scorpio (Lord Mars is in the Afflicted Leo cluster).
*   **Sun (Pisces):** 2nd House is Aries (Lord Mars is in the Afflicted Leo cluster).
*   **Verdict:** Since the savings block appears in **3 out of 3 charts**, the confidence level is **100%**. This is a structural karmic lesson, not just bad luck. You cannot "save" your way out; you must "invest" your way out (locking money away where you cannot touch it).

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D9 Navamsa)
In the D9 Navamsa:
*   **Mars** moves to **Aries (Own Sign)**. This is a massive "Rags to Riches" indicator (Neecha Bhanga potential). It means that although you spend impulsively (D1), you have the *internal discipline* (D9) to build assets if you channel that energy into forced investments (like real estate or locked bonds) rather than liquid savings.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your 2nd House planets sit in **Magha** and **Purva Phalguni**.
*   **Magha (Ket):** Indicates money spent on lineage, family status, or past karmic debts.
*   **Purva Phalguni (Ven):** Indicates money spent on leisure and comfort.
*   **Guidance:** You are subconsciously spending to maintain a "royal" image (Leo). Recognize this pattern to break it.

### Timing & Guidance
*   **Jan - June 2026 (The Hold):** Do not expect to save. Focus on debt reduction. Avoid new financial commitments.
*   **July 2026 Onwards (The Build):** As **Siddha (Venus)** starts, open a recurring deposit or investment that auto-debits on payday.
*   **Remedy:** Since the 2nd House (Leo) is the bottleneck, offer water to the Sun (Surya) daily. More practically, "hide" your money from yourself—use illiquid assets (Gold/PPF) instead of savings accounts.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are not "bad with money"; you are battling a planetary cluster that demands **circulation**, not stagnation. 2026 is the year you stop fighting the current and build a dam. By July, the stars align for retention—be ready to capture the flow.</div>

        
        Current question: "salary growth."
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge
        - D27 (Nakshatramsa): Strengths, weaknesses, general fortune
        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028
