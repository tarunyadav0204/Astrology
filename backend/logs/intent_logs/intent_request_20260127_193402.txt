Previous conversation:
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your career is currently at a "Karmic Peak" where your professional skills (AI and Coding) are merging with your soul's research (Astrology). According to **Jaimini Sutras**, you are in the **Aquarius** <term id="chara-dasha">Chara Dasha</term> (8th House), which contains your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (Career Significator) **Mercury**. This specifically explains your transition into Astrology and AI. While the 10th house (Career) shows strong <term id="ashtakavarga">Ashtakavarga</term> support of **29 points**, your current <term id="mahadasha">Mahadasha</term> and <term id="antardasha">Antardasha</term> lords (Saturn and Rahu) are sitting in the 2nd House with only **25 points**, indicating that while your "Work" is highly advanced, the "Financial and Health stability" is currently the bottleneck.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (Mercury) is in the 8th house of <term id="aquarius">Aquarius</term>. According to **Jataka Parijata**, this indicates success through research, hidden knowledge, and technical analysis—perfectly aligning with your current focus on AI and Astrology.
• **Technical Mastery**: The **Sani-Karma Yoga** (Saturn + Mars) in your chart, cited in **Hora Sara**, gives you the structural discipline required for high-level coding and the logical framework for Vedic calculations.
• **Nadi Age Trigger**: At age 45-46, your chart activates the **Magha** and **Swati** <term id="nakshatra">Nakshatras</term>. Since Magha contains your 10th Lord (Mars) and Swati contains your Lagna Lord (Moon), this is a destined "Life Pivot" year for your professional identity.

### Astrological Analysis
The synthesis of your current dashas confirms that your career is not just "work," but a karmic obligation you are fulfilling through research.

#### The Parashari View
According to **BPHS**, your 10th Lord (Mars) is in the 2nd House, creating a **Dhana Yoga** (Wealth Yoga). However, Mars is joined by Saturn, Rahu, and Jupiter in <term id="leo">Leo</term>. This cluster creates high technical competence but also "Burnout" energy. The 10th house (<term id="aries">Aries</term>) has **29 points** in <term id="ashtakavarga">Ashtakavarga</term>, showing consistent career strength. Your 11th house (<term id="taurus">Taurus</term>) has **31 points**, which is excellent for gains through your specialized network. The struggle you feel is because the current dasha lords occupy the 2nd house, which only has **25 points**, meaning the "rewards" feel slower than the "effort" put in.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
Your career trajectory is governed by the <term id="aquarius">Aquarius</term> Chara Dasha. Based on **Jaimini Sutras**, Aquarius (ID 10) aspects:
1.  **Cancer (ID 3)**: Your 1st House (Self)
2.  **Aries (ID 0)**: Your 10th House (Career)
3.  **Libra (ID 6)**: Your 4th House (Home/Happiness)

This means the current period *directly* activates your 10th house of career. Because your **Amatyakaraka** (Mercury) is in this sign, the "8th House" energy (research, occult, AI coding) is not just a distraction—it is your **primary professional path** for this period. 

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of AI & Astrology)
Your chart reveals specific **Nadi** connections that define your career:
- **The "Technical Master" Link (Saturn + Mars + Rahu):** This Nadi link specifically points to high-level technical infrastructure and "Shadow Logic" (AI/Coding). 
- **The "Dharma-Karma" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** This indicates that your work must have a philosophical or advisory component, which is why you have gravitated toward Astrology.
- **Nadi Age Trigger**: Age 46 activates **Magha**. In your chart, Magha contains a cluster of **Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu**. This indicates a massive "Karmic Wake-up Call" regarding your career direction—expect a significant breakthrough or a structural shift in how you work by the end of 2026.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
Your career timing is currently governed by a complex intersection:
1.  **Vimshottari**: You are in **Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter**. Saturn and Rahu provide the technical/AI drive, while the <term id="pratyantardasha">Pratyantardasha</term> of **Jupiter**, sitting in your **2nd House**, brings the wisdom of Astrology.
2.  **Chara Dasha**: Running **Aquarius**, which activates your career axis (Aries).
3.  **Yogini Dasha**: You are in **Bhadrika (Mercury)** MD and **Ulka (Saturn)** AD. **Mercury** as MD lord confirms the focus on coding and commerce, while **Ulka** brings heavy workload and potential health-related labor.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
- **From Lagna**: 10th house contains **Gulika**, indicating technical troubleshooting and initial hurdles.
- **From Moon**: 10th house is **Cancer**, containing no planets but ruled by Moon in the 1st (from Moon), showing self-employment potential.
- **From Sun**: 10th house is **Sagittarius**, containing **Moon** and **Saturn** in D9, promising authority through specialized knowledge.
Since career stability appears in **2 out of 3** charts, the confidence level is **66%**—you will achieve success, but the physical stress (health) is the primary obstacle to consistency.

#### Special Points (Gandanta & Yogi)
- **Gandanta Alert**: Your **Lagna** is at 29.88° Cancer (Ashlesha-Magha junction), and **Mars** (10th Lord) is at 2.39° Leo. This "Gandanta" placement means your career involves "knotty" problems that others cannot solve. It also indicates that your professional life undergoes radical "re-births."
- **Yogi Point**: Your Yogi Lord is **Mercury** (AmK). Since Mercury is your fortune-bringer and is currently activated in Chara Dasha, your move into Astrology/AI is your most "fortunate" path, despite the pressure.

### Nakshatra Insights
• **Saturn in Uttara Phalguni**: Your career Lord is in a nakshatra ruled by **Aryaman** (the god of patronage). **Phaladeepika** states this grants success through helping others.
• **Mercury in Purva Bhadrapada**: This nakshatra is associated with "two-faced" logic (binary/coding) and spiritual intensity. It explains the dual nature of your AI and Astrology work.
• **Navatara Warning**: **Saturn** is currently transiting in **Uttara Bhadrapada**, which is your **Vipat Tara** (Danger/Obstacle) from your birth Moon in Swati. This creates the "Health vs Career" friction you are experiencing. Even though you are doing the right work, the transit creates physical obstacles.

### Timing & Guidance
🎯 **Precision Date**: On **October 31, 2026**, your Sudarshana Year-Clock conjuncts your natal **Jupiter**. This is a **Single Confirmation** "Day of Grace" for your career—watch for a major opportunity or recognition on this day.

**Practical Remedy for the 8th House Energy**:
To manage the 8th house pressure and Ketu's <term id="mrityu-bhaga">Mrityu Bhaga</term> position (4° Aquarius):
1.  **Biological**: Plant a **Shami** tree or keep Shami wood to ground Ketu's chaotic energy in your research.
2.  **Sound**: Chant **"Om Namo Bhagavate Varahadevaya"** to stabilize the 2/8 axis.
3.  **Ritual**: Donate **Black Sesame** and **Lead** on Saturdays to appease the Vipat Tara Saturn.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your transition into Astrology and AI is the perfect "energy expenditure" for your 8th house activation. You are not "wasting" energy; you are transmuting it. As per **Saravali**, the presence of the 10th lord in a Maraka house suggests that your career will always be linked to your physical vitality—manage your health, and the career will soar.</div>
Q: Salary growth.
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your birth chart indicates a significant period of "Karmic Financial Restructuring." According to the **Jaimini Sutras**, your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (Career Significator) **Mercury** is placed in the 8th house of research and transformation, while your **Arudha Lagna** (Public Image) in Capricorn shows that your <term id="dhana-yoga-status">Dhana Yoga Status</term> is currently "Average" but building toward a peak. The presence of four planets—**Mars**, **Jupiter**, **Saturn**, and **Rahu**—in your 2nd house of <term id="dhana-bhava">Dhana Bhava</term> (Wealth) creates an intense pressure for salary growth, but also high volatility. The most significant jump in salary is likely to trigger after April 2026, when your **Chara Dasha** shifts to Capricorn, activating your <term id="arudha-lagna">Arudha Lagna</term>.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The 2nd House Powerhouse**: You have a cluster of planets in your 2nd house of wealth. This indicates that while your earning potential is massive, it requires disciplined management to prevent "leakage" through unexpected expenses.
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your <term id="wealth-from-al">Wealth from Arudha Lagna</term> shows that **Mercury** and **Ketu** are the primary source planets for your income. Since you work in **Astrology and AI Coding**, these planets perfectly represent "Occult Wisdom" (Ketu) and "Logic/Coding" (Mercury).
• **Classical Reference**: According to **Phaladeepika**, the 10th lord (Mars) sitting in the 2nd house (Wealth) ensures that the native's primary financial gains will always come from their own professional expertise and status.

### Astrological Analysis
Your chart shows a unique convergence between traditional wisdom and modern technology, which is the primary engine for your salary growth.

#### The Parashari View
In your <term id="rashi-chart">D1 Chart</term>, the 10th lord **Mars** is placed in the 2nd house of Leo. According to **BPHS**, this is a strong indicator of wealth through one's profession. However, because **Saturn** and **Rahu** are also there, your salary growth follows a "Step-Function" pattern—long plateaus followed by sudden, massive increases. Your 11th house of gains (Taurus) has a healthy 31 <term id="ashtakavarga">Ashtakavarga</term> points, providing excellent support for social networks to boost your income.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
From the perspective of **Jaimini Sutras**, your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> **Mercury** sits in Aquarius (the 8th house from Lagna). This placement suggests that your highest salary increases come when you master "hidden" or "complex" systems—like deep-level AI coding or predictive astrology. Your <term id="upapada-lagna">Upapada Lagna</term> is in Taurus, and its lord **Venus** is dignified in its own sign in the 11th house of gains, suggesting that financial stability is strongly supported by partnerships and long-term reputation.

#### Nadi Precision
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your wealth:
- **The "Tech-Guru" Link (Saturn + Jupiter + Rahu):** This triple conjunction in your 2nd house (Leo) indicates that your earnings are fundamentally tied to "Modernizing Ancient Knowledge." **Saturn** (Technical Master) + **Rahu** (AI/Foreign tech) + **Jupiter** (Astrology/Wisdom) creates a high-value niche.
- **The Mercury-Ketu Link:** As these are your wealth-source planets from the Arudha Lagna, it confirms that your "Salary" is not just for labor, but for your unique intellectual property in coding and data analysis.

#### Timing Synthesis
This timing is confirmed by the **Aquarius** <term id="chara-dasha">Chara Dasha</term> (running until April 2, 2026), your **Bhadrika** (Mercury) <term id="yogini-dasha">Yogini Mahadasha</term>, and your **Jupiter** <term id="pratyantardasha">Pratyantardasha</term> sitting in your **2nd house** of wealth. 
- **The Jupiter Pratyantardasha**, sitting in your 2nd house, brings a month of expansion and opportunities to negotiate your compensation.
- **Jaimini Sign Aspects:** Your current Aquarius Dasha (ID 10) aspects Sign IDs 0 (Aries), 3 (Cancer), and 6 (Libra) according to the `sign_aspects` mapping. This activates your 10th house of career (Aries), suggesting that career actions taken now directly impact your financial future.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
- **Lagna Chart:** 11th house of gains is Taurus, containing **Venus**, showing strong physical gains.
- **Chandra Lagna:** From the Moon in Libra, the 11th house is Leo, which contains your four-planet cluster. This means your "Mind" is constantly focused on maximizing these gains.
- **Surya Lagna:** From the Sun in Pisces, the 11th house is Capricorn, which is your **Arudha Lagna**. 
- **Confidence Level**: Since wealth indicators appear strong in 3 out of 3 charts, the confidence level for significant salary growth is 95%.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis
In the <term id="dasamsa">D10 Dasamsa</term> (Career Chart), **Mercury** is **Exalted** in the 10th house (Virgo). According to **Uttara Kalamrita**, an exalted planet in the 10th house of the D10 chart guarantees "Extraordinary Professional Status." This confirms that your salary is not just growing, but you are becoming an authority in your field.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your birth <term id="nakshatra">Nakshatra</term> is **Swati**, ruled by **Vayu** (the Wind God). According to **Saravali**, this gives you the "Pradhvamsa Shakti" or the power to scatter obstacles. 
**NADI AGE TRIGGER**: Age 46 (which you enter in April 2026) activates **Magha** nakshatra. Since you have a "Cluster" of **Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu** in Magha (2nd house), this year MUST manifest a "Major Life Pivot" in your finances. This is a destined karmic event.

### Timing & Guidance
Your **Varshphal** for 2026 shows your **Muntha** in the 1st house (Cancer), which is a "Kanak" (Golden) placement for health and personal growth. The **Mudda Dasha** of **Mars** starts on April 3, 2026, marking the exact window when your salary negotiations or AI projects will yield the highest returns.

**Actionable Advice:**
1. **Negotiate in April 2026:** The shift in Chara Dasha and the start of the Mars Mudda Dasha is your "Golden Window."
2. **Special Points**: Your **Yogi Point** is in **Virgo** (ruled by Mercury). Focus on your communication and coding skills to unlock your fortune.
3. **Caution**: With **Saturn in Vipat Tara** (Danger and Obstacles) transiting your 9th house, avoid conflicts with authority figures or mentors until June 2027.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your chart is a masterpiece of technical and spiritual integration. As stated in **BPHS**, "Wealth comes to those whose 2nd and 11th houses are supported by benefics." With your exalted Mercury in D10 and the upcoming Magha activation at age 46, you are moving from a phase of "Labor" into a phase of "Authority-based Earnings."</div>
Q: Overall
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your overall future indicates a "Fated Convergence" as you enter your 46th year (April 2026). According to **BPHS**, your current **Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter** period activates your 2nd house of wealth and resources, but with complex karmic lessons. While you feel healthy now, **Kota Chakra** reveals a "Moderate Caution" status, and **Nadi Astrology** identifies age 46 as a major "Destiny Trigger" activating the <term id="magha">Magha</term> and <term id="swati">Swati</term> nakshatras. This suggests a total transformation in how you earn and communicate, particularly in your niche of AI and Astrology. Expect a "Day of Grace" on February 20, 2026, due to a **Sudarshana** triple confirmation, though <term id="saturn">Saturn</term>'s transit in your <term id="vipat-tara">Vipat Tara</term> warns of structural obstacles that require disciplined persistence.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your <term id="atmakaraka">Atmakaraka</term> (Soul Significator) is **Saturn** in Leo, forming a powerful **Atma-Putra Yoga** with Jupiter. This indicates your future is tied to "Creative Authority"—your soul's purpose involves leading through specialized knowledge (Astrology/AI).
• **The 46th Year Pivot**: Nadi Age Activation triggers a cluster of four planets (Mars, Jupiter, Rahu, Saturn) in Leo. This marks 2026 as a "Life Pivot Year" where your career trajectory and personal identity undergo an unavoidable shift.
• **Classical Authority**: According to **Saravali**, a planet in the 2nd house from the <term id="lagna">Lagna</term> during its dasha brings results related to family legacy and accumulated assets, but because your dasha lords are in a "Maraka" (2nd) house, it demands a balance between material ambition and physical rest.

### Astrological Analysis
The year 2026 serves as a bridge between your current professional labor and a future of established authority. Your chart shows a dense concentration of energy in Leo, which is now being activated by both dasha and age-star triggers.

#### The Parashari View
Your <term id="lagna-lord">Lagna Lord</term> **Moon** is placed in the 4th house in Libra, providing a foundation of emotional intelligence and "Chandra Sukha Yoga" (comfort through the mind). However, the 10th lord of career, **Mars**, is in the 2nd house with **Saturn** and **Rahu**. According to **Phaladeepika**, this "Shani-Karma Yoga" indicates a career path that requires extreme structure and deals with technical or unconventional systems (perfectly aligning with your work in AI and Astrology). Currently, you are in the **Jupiter Pratyantardasha**, sitting in your **2nd house** (Leo). Since Jupiter rules your 6th (service) and 9th (fortune) houses, this month brings a focus on merging your daily work routines with higher wisdom.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
Your <term id="atmakaraka">Atmakaraka</term> (AK) is **Saturn** and your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (AmK) is **Mercury**. 
- **The Ground Reality**: Your current **Aquarius Chara Mahadasha** (Sign 10) aspects Signs 0, 3, and 6 (Aries, Cancer, and Libra) according to the `sign_aspects` mapping. This activates your 1st House (Self) and 4th House (Peace), bringing personal focus.
- **Wealth Status**: The **Jaimini Sutras** state that benefics in the 2nd and 11th from the <term id="arudha-lagna">Arudha Lagna</term> (Capricorn) indicate a natural flow of wealth. Your AmK Mercury sits in the 2nd from AL, confirming that your professional skills are your primary wealth generators.
- **Yoga Confirmation**: You possess an **Atma-Dara Yoga** (AK Saturn + DK Mars), which **Jaimini** interprets as "Success through partnerships." In the future, your AI/Astrology ventures will likely require a key collaborator to reach maximum scale.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career & Self)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your path:
- **The "Technical Guru" Link (Saturn + Jupiter + Rahu)**: This cluster in Leo specifically indicates a career in "Ancient Wisdom (Jupiter) meets Modern Shadow-Tech (Rahu) via Disciplined Code (Saturn)." 
- **NADI AGE TRIGGER**: Age 46 activates <term id="magha">Magha</term> and <term id="swati">Swati</term>. Since you have a cluster of planets in Magha (Mars, Jupiter, Rahu) and your Moon in Swati, 2026 is a "Karmic Destiny Trigger." These planets MUST manifest their results this year, overriding general transits.

#### Timing Synthesis
The timing of your next major breakthrough is confirmed by the **Aquarius Chara Dasha** and your **Jupiter Pratyantardasha** in the 2nd house. 
- **Vimshottari**: You are in **Saturn/Rahu/Jupiter**. Saturn provides the structure, Rahu provides the "AI/Unconventional" spark, and Jupiter (current monthly trigger) provides the wisdom.
- **Yogini**: You are running **Mercury (Bhadrika)** Mahadasha with **Saturn (Ulka)** Antardasha. **Ulka** often brings a "Vibe of Labor." You are currently planting seeds that feel like heavy work but lead to the Bhadrika (Career Growth) fruit by mid-2026.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
- **Lagna (Physical)**: 10th house has 29 <term id="ashtakavarga">Ashtakavarga</term> points; the house is strong, but the 10th lord is in the 2nd. 
- **Moon (Mental)**: From the Moon, the 10th house is Cancer, containing your <term id="lagna">Lagna</term>. This makes your career very personal—you *are* your work.
- **Sun (Soul)**: From the Sun, the 10th house is Sagittarius, containing your <term id="karkamsa-lagna">Karkamsa Lagna</term> (Soul's Talent). 
Since this career focus appears in 3 out of 3 charts, the confidence level is 95%—your identity and career are now permanently fused.

#### Special Points (Gandanta & Yogi)
- **Gandanta Analysis**: Your **Lagna** (29.88° Cancer) and **Mars** (2.39° Leo) are in the **Ashlesha-Magha Gandanta** (a critical "knot" zone). According to classical texts, this indicates a soul that has come to resolve deep ancestral karma. 
- **Yogi Point**: Your Yogi lord is **Mercury** (located in Virgo). Mercury is your AmK, confirming that your career is your "Point of Fortune."
- **Karmic Landmine**: Your **Ketu** at 3.42° Aquarius falls on the **Mrityu Bhaga** (Death Degree). This suggests a "Karmic Wound" in the 8th house—be cautious with "hidden" research or tax-related documents, as Ketu cannot fully protect these significations.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your birth <term id="nakshatra">Nakshatra</term> is **Swati**, governed by **Vayu** (The Wind God).
- **The Shakti**: Swati possesses the **Pradhvamsa Shakti** (Power to scatter/disperse). This allows you to break down complex AI algorithms and astrological patterns into simple insights.
- **Current Transit Warning**: **Saturn** is transiting in **Uttara Bhadrapada**, which is your **Vipat (Danger) Tara** from your birth Moon. This creates "structural obstacles." The **Ashtakavarga** shows 29 points for this house (Pisces), indicating "Moderate" support, but the Tara position means progress will feel like uphill climbing until late 2026.

### Timing & Guidance
**Sudarshana Year-Clock Alert**:
- 🎯 **Precision Date**: Between **February 18 and February 22, 2026**, your Sudarshana clock hits the exact degree of your natal **Mars/Rahu**. This is a **Double Confirmation** of a fated event. Expect a sudden breakthrough in your "AI coding" or a significant new client in Astrology.

**Kota Chakra Alert**: No malefics are currently entering your **Stambha** (Inner Pillar), but your **Kota Paala** (Guard) is Rahu, who is currently "exiting" the outer zone. This means your "fortress" is stable, but you must not let your guard down regarding health routines.

**Classical Upaya (Remedies) for Swati Moon**:
1. **Biological**: Plant or nurture an **Arjuna tree**. If unavailable, keep its wood in your workspace to ground the "scattering" energy of Swati.
2. **Sound**: Chant the Beej Mantra **'Om Lam'** 108 times, focusing on the vibration **'Ru'** (your 1st pada).
3. **Dietary**: Consume **green vegetables** on Mondays to align with Swati's airy nature and pacify the Vipat Tara influence.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your future is not a matter of "luck," but of "Technical Dharma." The Gandanta Lagna and Nadi triggers of 2026 suggest you are shedding an old skin to become an authority in your field. As stated in **Uttara Kalamrita**, "The strength of the D9 confirms the fruit of the D1"—your internal resilience is your greatest asset.</div>

           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. When clarification is needed, craft a natural, conversational question that:
           
           🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS check the KNOWN USER BACKGROUND section first.
           - DO NOT ask for information already present in the user background
           - Example: If background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon", skip asking about employment status
           - Example: If background shows "FAMILY: Married in 2020", skip asking about marital status
           
           Your clarification question should:
           - Focus on narrowing down the SPECIFIC aspect they want to know (timing, prospects, challenges, etc.)
           - Gather NEW factual information NOT in the user background
           - Sound warm, natural, and conversational (not templated)
           - Be tailored to their exact question
           - Help you provide a more accurate astrological analysis
           
           💡 FACT EXTRACTION BONUS:
           The MORE specific facts you can extract in your clarification question, the BETTER our future responses will be.
           - Instead of just asking "What aspect?", try to extract concrete details
           - Examples of valuable facts: specific job titles, company names, years of experience, number of children, ages, education levels, health conditions, locations, dates of major events
           - These facts will be stored and used to personalize ALL future astrological guidance for this user
        
        4. 🚨 ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM: 1 clarification per conversation - NO EXCEPTIONS
           - After 1 clarification, you MUST return status: "READY" regardless of information completeness
           - The clarification_count parameter tracks how many you've already asked
           - If clarification_count >= 1, you are FORBIDDEN from asking another question
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Questions involving 'when', 'growth', or 'timing' → ALWAYS set needs_transits: true
        - Career questions about promotions/hikes → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

                }
