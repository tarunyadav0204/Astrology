Q: My question is about progeny. I had 2 IVFs in second half of 2025 and both failed. I want to now understand what is wrong astrologically and when can my IVF be successful.
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The IVF challenges in late 2025 were caused by the restrictive "Karmic Freeze" of **Transit Saturn** (in your 8th House of obstacles) casting its 10th aspect directly onto your natal 5th House, blocking the "fruit" of the procedure. However, your D9 Navamsa shows a powerful **Jupiter in its Own Sign (Pisces)**, confirming that progeny is definitely promised. Specifically, expect success between **October 31, 2026 – January 24, 2027**, when Jupiter transits your Ascendant and activates your 5th House. Plan your next medical intervention for this "Double Transit" window.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The Root of the Delay**: Your 5th House (Progeny) contains **Mars** and **Venus**. While Mars is a Yogakaraka, its presence here indicates "Surgical/Technical" birth (IVF), and Venus acts as the *Gnatikaraka* (GK), creating biological obstacles that require medical workarounds.
*   **The 2025 Block**: During late 2025, you were in the **Jupiter-Saturn** Vimshottari period. Saturn, being the 6th Lord (obstacles), cast a restrictive aspect on your 5th Lord Jupiter, effectively "denying" the result temporarily.
*   **The Jaimini Confirmation**: You are currently in the **Sagittarius Chara Mahadasha** (your 5th House sign), which keeps the focus on children. The upcoming **Aquarius Antardasha** (starting Feb 2026) is the 2nd house from your Arudha Lagna (AL), signaling "Family Expansion."

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View
Your 5th House (Sagittarius) is activated by Mars and Venus. Mars here confirms that conception will likely require technical assistance (IVF/IUI). The 5th Lord, **Jupiter**, is placed in the 4th House (Scorpio) with the **Sun** (Putrakaraka - Significator of Children).
*   **The Issue:** In late 2025, the sub-period lord was **Saturn**. Saturn is the natural *Karaka* for delay. From the 7th/8th house transit, Saturn was aspecting your natal 5th house, creating a "cold" environment that prevented implantation.
*   **The Shift:** In **July 2026**, you enter the **Jupiter-Mercury** Dasha. Mercury is conjunct your 5th Lord Jupiter and rules your 2nd House (Family). This shifts the energy from "Obstacle (Saturn)" to "Gain/Addition (Mercury)."

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
*   **Putrakaraka (PK):** Your PK is the **Sun**, placed in Scorpio.
*   **Gnatikaraka (GK):** Your GK is **Venus**, placed in the 5th House. In Jaimini, the GK causes blockages due to biological factors (hormonal or structural).
*   **Relative Analysis:** From your current **Sagittarius** Chara Mahadasha, the 5th House is **Aries** (containing Ketu). This confirms the need for "unconventional" (Ketu) methods. The upcoming **Aquarius** Antardasha (Feb 2026) places the 5th House (Gemini) in the 5th position from itself (*Bhavat Bhavam*), strongly supporting childbirth.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Progeny)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the nature of this event:
*   **The "Sanjivani" Link (Jupiter + Mars):** Your Jupiter (Progeny) has a direct Nadi link to Mars (Surgery/Technology). This specifically indicates "Childbirth through technical intervention."
*   **The "Biological" Link (Venus + Mars):** Venus in the 5th house linked with Mars suggests inflammation or heat in the reproductive system. The remedy lies in "Cooling" Mars (patience and timing) rather than forcing it.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
This timing is confirmed by **Sagittarius** Chara Dasha (activating 5th House), **Bhramari** Yogini (starting Feb 2026), and your **Mercury** Antardasha.
*   **Vimshottari:** The **Jupiter-Mercury** period (starts July 2026) is the "Golden Period." Mercury is with the 5th Lord Jupiter.
*   **Transits (The Trigger):** The decisive factor is **Transit Jupiter**.
    *   **Oct 31, 2026 – Jan 24, 2027:** Jupiter moves into **Leo** (your Ascendant). From here, it casts its direct 5th aspect on your 5th House (Sagittarius).
    *   Simultaneously, Saturn (in Pisces) will aspect the 5th House.
    *   **The Rule:** When BOTH Jupiter and Saturn aspect the 5th House (Double Transit), childbirth is "Authorized" by the cosmos.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **Lagna (Leo):** 5th House contains Mars/Venus (Medical need).
*   **Moon (Capricorn):** 5th House from Moon is **Taurus**, occupied by Saturn (in D1). This confirms the delay/stress felt emotionally regarding children.
*   **Sun (Scorpio):** 5th House from Sun is **Pisces**, which is Jupiter's own sign. This is the **Soul's Guarantee** that progeny is destined, regardless of the delay.
*   **Verdict:** 2 out of 3 charts show challenges, but the Soul (Sun) chart guarantees success. Confidence: 85%.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D7 Saptamsa)
In the D7 chart (specific for children):
*   **Lagna:** Leo (same as D1).
*   **5th House:** Sagittarius, containing the **Moon**.
*   **5th Lord:** Jupiter is in **Scorpio** (3rd House).
*   **Key Strength:** The D7 Lagna Lord (Sun) is in the 11th House (Gains), promising the fulfillment of desires regarding children.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your 5th Lord Jupiter is in **Jyeshtha** Nakshatra (ruled by Mercury). Jyeshtha represents "The Eldest" or "Authority." The fact that your upcoming Antardasha is **Mercury** (ruler of Jyeshtha) indicates that the "fruit" of this Nakshatra will ripen specifically in the Mercury period (starting July 2026).

### Timing & Guidance
**Primary Success Window:** **October 31, 2026 to January 24, 2027**.
*   **Why:** Jupiter in Lagna activates the 5th House + Mercury Antardasha + Double Transit.

**Actionable Strategy:**
1.  **Medical Timing:** Schedule the next stimulation/transfer cycle to align with **late October or November 2026**.
2.  **Remedy (Mars/Venus):** Since Mars/Venus in the 5th causes "Heat," consume cooling foods (avoid spicy/acidic) and perform *Subramanya* prayers on Tuesdays.
3.  **Protection:** During the **Rahu Pratyantardasha** (Jan 2026), focus on detoxifying the body to prepare for the Mercury period.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: The failure in 2025 was a "Timing Block," not a "Destiny Denial." Your D9 Jupiter is too strong to deny progeny. The cosmos opens the gate in **Late 2026**—use this time to prepare physically and mentally, as the astrological support will be at its peak.</div>
Q: My question is about progeny. I had 2 IVFs in second half of 2025 and both failed. I want to now understand what is wrong astrologically and when can my IVF be successful.
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The astrological reason for the IVF challenges in late 2025 was the restrictive "Karmic Freeze" of **Transit Saturn** in Aquarius casting its 10th aspect directly onto your natal 5th Lord **Jupiter** (in Scorpio), effectively blocking the "fruit" of progeny. Additionally, your D1 5th Lord is in the 12th from itself, indicating delays. However, your D9 Navamsa shows a powerful **Jupiter in its Own Sign (Pisces)**, confirming that progeny is definitely promised. Specifically, your "Golden Window" for success opens between **July 2026 and October 2026**, when the **Jupiter-Mercury** dasha aligns with a rare "Double Transit" activation of your 5th House. Focus on preparing your body now for this mid-2026 timeline.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The 2025 Block (Saturn's Grip):** The primary cause of failure was the transit of Saturn in your 7th house aspecting your 5th Lord (Jupiter). In Vedic astrology, Saturn's aspect on the progeny lord creates a "deferral" or "coldness" that often requires multiple attempts.
• **The D7 Saptamsa Promise:** In your D7 Divisional Chart (specific for children), the Lagna Lord **Mercury** is strong, and the 5th Lord **Saturn** is in the 11th House of Gains. This specific combination (5th lord in 11th) is a classic signature of "Success through Medical Intervention" or "Gains after Delay."
• **The Jaimini Confirmation:** The upcoming **Aquarius** Chara Antardasha (starting Feb 2026) activates your 9th House (Aries) via Jaimini aspect, stimulating the "Kshetra" (field/womb) for fertility.

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View (The Root Cause & Solution)
Your D1 chart shows the 5th House (Progeny) is **Sagittarius**, ruled by **Jupiter**.
- **The Challenge:** Natal Jupiter sits in the 4th House (Scorpio), which is the **12th from the 5th**. This placement ("loss of the house") often necessitates medical assistance (IVF) as natural conception can face energy leaks or losses.
- **The Trigger:** Currently, you are in the **Jupiter-Saturn** Vimshottari period (until June 2026). Saturn acts as a delay-inducer here.
- **The Solution (Mercury Antardasha):** In **July 2026**, you enter the **Jupiter-Mercury** period. Mercury is the **Lagna Lord of your D7 Saptamsa Chart** and sits with Jupiter in the D1. This shift from Saturn (Delay) to Mercury (D7 Lord) is the precise astrological switch required for success.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive (MANDATORY)
- **Putrakaraka (PK):** Your Child Significator is the **Sun** (11.25° in Scorpio).
- **Chara Dasha Context:** You are currently in the **Sagittarius Mahadasha**.
- **Antardasha Activation:** From **Feb 2026**, you enter the **Aquarius Antardasha**.
  - Aquarius (Fixed Sign) aspects **Aries** (Movable), which is your **9th House** (Dharma/Fortune).
  - This aspect on the 9th house is crucial because the 9th is the "secondary house of children" (5th from the 5th).
  - Unlike the previous period, this activation supports the *blessing* or *fortune* required for conception.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of the Event)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the medical nature of this journey:
- **The "Medical Intervention" Link (Venus + Mars + Ketu):** In Nadi astrology, the proximity of **Venus** and **Mars** (reproductive fluids) to **Ketu** (in trine) strongly indicates "unconventional" or "assisted" reproduction. Ketu represents tubes, needles, and medical technology. This confirms that IVF is the **correct** karmic path for you, not a mistake.
- **The "Jupiter-Mercury" Link:** The upcoming dasha lords are conjunct in your chart. Mercury acts as a "multiplier" to Jupiter (the Life Force), suggesting that success comes through *calculation* and *timing* (Mercury traits), reinforcing the need for a precise medical schedule.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
The period of **July 2026 – October 2026** is highlighted by a convergence of three systems:
1.  **Vimshottari:** **Jupiter-Mercury** Dasha begins July 2026. Mercury rules your D7 Lagna (Progeny Identity).
2.  **Transits (The "Double Transit" Rule):** By mid-2026, **Transit Jupiter** will be in Leo (1st House) and **Transit Saturn** will be in Pisces (8th House).
    - **Jupiter (Leo)** casts its 5th aspect on your **5th House (Sagittarius)**.
    - **Saturn (Pisces)** casts its 10th aspect on your **5th House (Sagittarius)**.
    - **Verdict:** When both major planets aspect the 5th House simultaneously, it creates an irresistible "Manifestation Vortex" for children. This only happens in mid-2026.
3.  **Pratyantardasha:** The **Rahu** Pratyantardasha (currently running, Jan-Feb 2026) is in your **3rd House**, creating anxiety. The shift to **Mercury/Ket** levels in late 2026 stabilizes the energy.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D7 Saptamsa)
- **D7 Lagna:** Virgo.
- **D7 5th Lord:** Saturn is in the **11th House** (Cancer).
- **Analysis:** The 5th Lord in the 11th is one of the best placements for "fulfillment of desires" regarding children. It denies *denial* but confirms *delay*. The fact that your current D1 dasha is Jupiter (placed in D7 3rd house) and next is Mercury (D7 Lagna Lord) confirms the biological capability is intact and waiting for the D7 Lagna Lord (Mercury) to take charge in July 2026.

### Nakshatra Insights
Your **Putrakaraka (Sun)** is in **Anuradha Nakshatra** (ruled by Saturn). Anuradha is symbolized by a "Lotus," which blooms only in muddy waters. This is a poetic confirmation that your path to motherhood involves navigating the "mud" of medical procedures and delays, but the outcome (the Lotus) is destined to bloom. It requires *friendship* and *devotion* (Anuradha themes)—suggesting that staying emotionally connected with your partner during this stress is vital for the soul of the child to enter.

### Timing & Guidance
**Primary Window:** **July 2026 to November 2026**.
**Secondary Window:** **February 2027 to June 2027**.

**Action Plan:**
1.  **Rest & Reset (Now - May 2026):** Do not rush into another cycle immediately during the tail end of Saturn Antardasha. Use this time to detox and strengthen the uterus (4th house matters).
2.  **Medical Timing:** Schedule the next stimulation cycle to align with **July 2026**, when Jupiter enters Leo and aspects your 5th house.
3.  **Remedy:** Since Natal Jupiter (5th Lord) is in a Watery Sign (Scorpio) in the 4th, perform water-based remedies. Offering water to the rising Sun (Putrakaraka) daily strengthens the "Soul" element of the child.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: The failure in 2025 was a "Protection" rather than a denial, caused by Saturn's heavy gaze on your progeny lord. The planetary gears shift in **July 2026**. Your chart does not show childlessness; it shows a "Lotus" destiny—beauty emerging after a struggle. Trust the mid-2026 timeline.</div>

        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Questions involving 'when', 'growth', or 'timing' → ALWAYS set needs_transits: true
        - Career questions about promotions/hikes → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
