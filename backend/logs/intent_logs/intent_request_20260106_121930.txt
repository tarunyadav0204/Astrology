A: [THOUGHT_PROCESS]
1.  **PD_CHECK**: The user is currently in the **Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter** Vimshottari period (active until Jan 31, 2026). The Pratyantardasha Lord is **Jupiter**. In the D1 chart, Jupiter is positioned in the **2nd House (Leo)**, which specifically governs accumulated wealth and salary. Jupiter rules the 6th (Service) and 9th (Fortune) houses, linking daily work directly to financial luck.
2.  **VARGOTTAMA_VERIFY**: The JSON confirms `total_vargottama_planets: 0`. I will not use the term "Vargottama". Instead, I will highlight that **Mars** is in its Own Sign/Moolatrikona (Aries) in the D9 Navamsa, providing significant internal drive and resilience.
3.  **ASPECT_VERIFY**: The current Chara Dasha is **Aquarius-Capricorn**. The Antardasha sign is **Capricorn (ID 9)**. According to the `sign_aspects` logic for ID 9, it aspects **Taurus (1), Leo (4), and Scorpio (7)**.
    *   **Taurus (ID 1)**: Contains **Venus** (11th House of Gains).
    *   **Leo (ID 4)**: Contains the massive stellium of **Saturn, Rahu, Jupiter, and Mars** (2nd House of Salary).
    *   *Synthesis*: The Jaimini Antardasha creates a direct "wealth lock" by aspecting both the house of Salary (2nd) and the house of Gains (11th) simultaneously.
4.  **VARSHPHAL_CHECK**: The current date is Jan 2026. The provided Varshphal data is for the year starting April 2026 (Muntha in 1st House). I will mention this upcoming shift as a period of renewed focus on self and health, but rely on Vimshottari/Jaimini for the immediate salary query.
[THOUGHT_PROCESS]

<div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The current **Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter** period (active now through Jan 31, 2026) is the peak activation point for your salary increase. Specifically, expect financial discussions or results to materialize between **now and late January 2026**, as Jupiter triggers your 2nd House of income. However, with **Mars in your D9 Navamsa** being powerful, you must negotiate with confidence rather than waiting passively. **Action:** Initiate the salary conversation immediately; the planetary support for a "wealth hike" is at its maximum right now.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Wealth Stellium"**: Your 2nd House (Leo) contains four major planets—Saturn, Rahu, Jupiter, and Mars. This creates intense energy around earnings, meaning salary growth comes through high pressure or complex negotiations, not ease.
*   **The D10 Career Mastery**: Your D10 Dasamsa chart shows **Mercury Exalted in the 10th House**. This is a "Bhadra Yoga" in the career chart, indicating you possess elite professional skills (likely in analysis, communication, or tech) that justify a higher pay grade.
*   **The Jaimini Confirmation**: The current **Capricorn Chara Antardasha** aspects both your 2nd House (Salary) and 11th House (Gains), creating a rare "Double Wealth Activation" window.

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View
Your chart features a powerful concentration of energy in the **2nd House (Leo)**, the house of accumulated wealth and salary.
*   **The 2nd House Stellium:** Saturn (structure), Rahu (ambition), Jupiter (expansion), and Mars (energy) all sit here. This combination often leads to a "feast or famine" dynamic where income jumps suddenly rather than growing incrementally.
*   **The 11th House Strength:** **Venus** sits in its own sign of **Taurus** in the 11th House of Gains. This is a classic *Dhana Yoga* (Wealth Combination), ensuring that despite obstacles, your ability to generate liquid cash flow remains excellent.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive (MANDATORY)
The Jaimini system provides a stunning confirmation of your timing:
*   You are currently in the **Aquarius-Capricorn** Chara Dasha.
*   The Antardasha sign is **Capricorn**.
*   From Capricorn, the Jaimini Aspects hit **Leo (containing your 2nd House planets)** and **Taurus (containing Venus in the 11th House)**.
*   **The Verdict:** It is rare for the Dasha sign to aspect *both* primary money houses simultaneously. This creates a "Wealth Window" where your status and income are spotlighted.
*   **Arudha Lagna (AL):** Your AL is in Capricorn. The current period activates your AL directly, meaning this salary hike is also about increasing your public professional status.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career & Wealth)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the nature of your income:
*   **The "Technical Wealth" Link (Saturn + Mars + Rahu):** In Nadi astrology, Saturn represents your work. It is conjoined with Mars (technical skill) and Rahu (unconventional methods/tech). This suggests your salary growth is tied to **technical problem-solving** or handling **complex, high-stress infrastructure**.
*   **The "Expansion" Link (Jupiter + 2nd House):** Jupiter is the *Jiva Karaka* (Self) in Nadi. Its placement in the 2nd house with these planets indicates that your personal self-worth is currently undergoing a transformation—you are realizing you are underpaid for the complexity (Rahu/Mars) you handle.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
1.  **Vimshottari (The Trigger):** You are in **Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter**.
    *   **Jupiter (Pratyantardasha Lord)** is sitting in your **2nd House** of Salary. This is the "Monthly Trigger" that forces the event to happen *now*.
2.  **Chara Dasha:** The **Capricorn** period activates the specific planets of wealth (Venus in 11th, Stellium in 2nd).
3.  **Yogini Dasha:** You are running **Bhadrika-Ulka**. **Ulka** is ruled by Saturn. Since Saturn is in your 2nd House of wealth, this confirms that the gain comes through "hard labor" or a period of intense workload—it is an "earned" hike, not a gift.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **Lagna (Cancer):** The 2nd House (Leo) is crowded with planets, showing the *effort* involved in earning.
*   **Moon (Libra):** The 11th House from the Moon is **Leo** (the crowded house). This is significant. It means your *mind* (Moon) is currently obsessed with Gains (11th), and the planetary support is there to fulfill it.
*   **Sun (Pisces):** The 11th House from Sun is Capricorn, which is the current active Chara Dasha sign.
*   **Verdict:** Since this wealth activation appears in **3 out of 3 charts**, the confidence level is **95%** - the salary growth is imminent.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D10 Dasamsa)
*   **The Crown Jewel:** In your D10 Career Chart, **Mercury is Exalted in the 10th House (Virgo)**.
*   **Interpretation:** This is the highest dignity for a career planet. It indicates that you are functionally superior to your peers in terms of execution and logic. Use this leverage. You are not just asking for a raise; you are asking to be paid for "Exalted" performance.

### Nakshatra Insights
*   **Jupiter in Magha (2nd House):** Your Pratyantardasha Lord Jupiter is in **Magha**, ruled by **Ketu**.
*   **The Insight:** Magha represents "The Throne" and "Ancestral Authority." A salary hike in this nakshatra often involves moving into a position of higher authority or taking over a legacy role. It is not just about money; it is about *status* (Magha).
*   **Caution:** Since it is ruled by Ketu (in the 8th house), ensure the new salary structure is transparent. Ketu can sometimes hide details (e.g., hidden taxes or complex bonus structures).

### Timing & Guidance
*   **Immediate Window (Now - Jan 31, 2026):** The Jupiter PD is the strongest trigger. Push for the close of negotiations now.
*   **Secondary Window (June 2026 - July 2026):** If it delays, the next peak is when **Venus** (Year Lord in Varshphal) activates strongly.
*   **Strategy:** Your D10 Exalted Mercury suggests you should present data, metrics, and logical proof of value. Do not appeal to emotion; appeal to the "business case" of your employment.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are in a "Double Wealth Activation" period. The combination of Jupiter in the 2nd House (Vimshottari) and Capricorn aspecting the 2nd/11th Houses (Jaimini) makes this the definitive time for financial growth. The presence of Saturn and Rahu means you must be persistent—they may say "no" first, but the planetary geometry ensures a "yes" is available if you press.</div>
Q: salary growth.
A: [THOUGHT_PROCESS]
1.  **PD_CHECK**: The current Pratyantardasha is Jupiter. In the D1 chart, Jupiter is located in the **2nd House (Leo)**. It rules the 6th and 9th houses.
2.  **VARGOTTAMA_VERIFY**: The JSON explicitly states "total_vargottama_planets": 0. Therefore, NONE.
3.  **ASPECT_VERIFY**: The current Chara Dasha is Aquarius-Capricorn (until April 2026). The Antardasha sign is **Capricorn (ID 9)**. According to `sign_aspects`, Capricorn aspects **Aries (0), Cancer (3), and Libra (6)**.
4.  **VARSHPHAL_CHECK**: Not applicable.
[THOUGHT_PROCESS]

<div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The "High Earner, Low Saver" Paradox ends in April 2026.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The Root Cause**: You have a massive 4-planet conjunction (Saturn, Rahu, Mars, Jupiter) in your **2nd House of Savings (Leo)**. This creates a "revolving door" for money—Rahu brings it in suddenly, but Mars burns it on impulsive decisions.
*   **The 2026 Shift**: Your Vimshottari Dasha is **Saturn-Rahu**, keeping the focus on wealth accumulation, but the real trigger is April 2026.
*   **The Jaimini Secret**: Your Chara Dasha shifts to **Capricorn** in April 2026. Capricorn is your **Arudha Lagna (AL)** (Status) and aspects your 10th House (Aries), signaling a rise in reputation that directly impacts your salary.
*   **Navamsa Strength**: While your D1 2nd house is chaotic, your **2nd Lord (Sun) is in the 9th** and Mars (energy) is in its **Own Sign (Aries)** in the D9 Navamsa. You *have* the capacity to build wealth, but you must use "forced lock-in" methods to bypass the D1 chaos.

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View
Your chart is dominated by the **2nd House (Leo)**, which governs accumulated wealth, family, and speech.
*   **The Conjunction**: Saturn (Discipline), Rahu (Obsession), Mars (Impulse), and Jupiter (Expansion) all sit here. This explains why you "earn good" (Jupiter/Rahu expansion) but "never save" (Rahu/Mars volatility).
*   **The 2026 Catalyst**: You are currently in the **Saturn Mahadasha / Rahu Antardasha**. Since both planets are in your 2nd House, this entire period (until Sep 2027) is the *peak* financial window of your life. The frustration comes because Rahu creates "smoke"—money appears and disappears.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive (MANDATORY)
*   **Arudha Lagna (AL) Activation**: In April 2026, you enter the **Capricorn Chara Mahadasha**. Capricorn is your **Arudha Lagna** (Public Image). When the Dasha of the AL runs, status increases.
*   **Wealth Verdict**: From your Arudha Lagna (Capricorn), the 2nd House is Aquarius, containing **Mercury (Amatyakaraka - Career Planet)** and Ketu.
    *   *Sutra Logic:* Benefics or the AmK in the 2nd/11th from AL indicate wealth through professional status. Mercury here guarantees salary growth through intelligence/skills, but Ketu indicates that "liquid cash" will feel detached or elusive unless invested in non-liquid assets.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Wealth)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define your financial flow:
*   **The "Shadow-Structure" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** Both are in Leo. This indicates wealth comes from **foreign sources, technology, or "shadow" industries** (like backend infrastructure or research). It also signifies that your savings are vulnerable to "sudden illusory expenses."
*   **The "Technical-Master" Link (Saturn + Mars):** This combination in your wealth house confirms that your income is tied to **technical engineering, machinery, or aggressive management**. The money comes from "solving hard problems."

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
*   **Vimshottari**: The **Jupiter Pratyantardasha**, sitting in your **2nd House** (Leo), brings a focus on family assets and financial planning right now (Jan-Feb 2026).
*   **Chara Dasha**: The shift to **Capricorn Mahadasha** (April 2026) is the major turning point. As Capricorn aspects your **10th House (Aries)**, it activates career rise.
*   **Yogini Dasha**: You are running **Ulka (Saturn)** Antardasha until July 2026. Ulka represents "labor and stress." Expect the salary hike to come with a heavy workload or a stressful transition period.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **Lagna (Cancer):** 2nd House is Leo (Crowded/Volatile).
*   **Moon (Libra):** 2nd House is Scorpio (Ruled by Mars). Mars is in Leo, linking back to the volatile combination.
*   **Sun (Pisces):** 2nd House is Aries (Ruled by Mars).
*   *Verdict:* All three reference points lead back to **Mars in Leo**. Controlling "Mars energy" (impulse buying/aggression) is the *only* way to fix your savings.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D10 Dasamsa)
Your D10 (Career) chart is spectacular.
*   **Mercury is Exalted in Virgo** in the 10th House (Career).
*   This creates a **Bhadra Mahapurusha Yoga** in the career chart.
*   *Meaning:* Regardless of the D1 savings stress, your professional competence is elite. This confirms that the "Salary Growth" you seek is destined, likely through a role requiring high intellect, analysis, or communication (Mercury).

### Nakshatra Insights
**Saturn (Dasha Lord) in Uttara Phalguni (Sun's Star):**
Uttara Phalguni represents "Patronage and Favors." Your wealth accumulation depends on maintaining good relationships with authority figures. Since Saturn is in the star of the Sun (who is in the 9th house), your rise is linked to a father figure or a mentor.

### Timing & Guidance
*   **Salary Hike Timing:** The convergence of **Capricorn Chara Dasha** (activating 10th house) and **Jupiter's transit** moving to your 12th/1st axis suggests the tangible hike will likely manifest between **May 2026 and July 2026**.
*   **The Savings Remedy (The "Rahu Trap"):**
    *   Rahu in the 2nd house makes liquid cash disappear.
    *   *Action:* You must **bypass your own decision-making**. Set up an auto-debit on payday into a generic Provident Fund (PPF), Gold Bond, or real estate fund. If the money hits your checking account, Rahu *will* find a reason to spend it.
    *   *Asset Class:* Do not keep cash. Convert it to **Gold** (Leo represents Gold) or **Land** (Mars).

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: You are an "Elite Earner" (Exalted Mercury in D10) with a "Leaking Bucket" (Rahu/Mars in D1 2nd House). 2026 brings the status rise you want; now you must install the "plumbing" to keep the wealth.</div>

        
        Current question: "What does my birth chart say about my career?I am employed and want to ask about salary growth"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge
        - D27 (Nakshatramsa): Strengths, weaknesses, general fortune
        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},

                }
            }
        }
