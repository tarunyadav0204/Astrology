### Astrological Analysis

**1. The Promise (Chart Analysis)**
Your <term id="ascendant">Ascendant</term> in <term id="cancer">Cancer</term> makes <term id="moon">Moon</term> your <term id="lagnalord">Lagna Lord</term>. For career, we examine the <term id="10thhouse">10th house</term> and its <term id="lord">lord</term>, <term id="saturn">Saturn</term> (natural <term id="karaka">Karaka</term> for career), and the <term id="d10">D10</term> <term id="dasamsa">Dasamsa</term>.
Your <term id="10thhouse">10th house</term> in the <term id="d1">D1</term> <term id="rashi">Rashi</term> chart is <term id="aries">Aries</term>, ruled by <term id="mars">Mars</term>. <term id="mars">Mars</term> is powerfully placed in the <term id="2ndhouse">2nd house</term> (<term id="leo">Leo</term>) conjunct with <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term>, <term id="saturn">Saturn</term>, and <term id="rahu">Rahu</term>. This stellium in the <term id="houseofwealth">house of wealth</term> indicates that your career will be a significant source of income and will involve roles where you command authority and respect.
The conjunction of <term id="10thlord">10th lord</term> <term id="mars">Mars</term> with <term id="saturn">Saturn</term> creates a <term id="shanikarmayoga">Śani-Karma Yoga</term>, signifying a structured, responsible, and diligent approach to work. Your career may involve engineering, technology, management, or leadership in fields demanding technical precision and strategic thinking. The <term id="dharmakarmayoga">Dharma-Karma Yoga</term> (Jupiter-Mars) suggests a career path aligned with righteous principles, bringing auspicious success. The <term id="gurumangalyoga">Guru-Mangal Yoga</term> (Jupiter-Mars) further enhances your aptitude for technical and scientific learning, pointing to intellectual and specialized professional pursuits.
The <term id="d10">D10</term> <term id="dasamsa">Dasamsa</term> is crucial for professional analysis. Your <term id="d10">D10</term> <term id="ascendant">Ascendant</term> is <term id="sagittarius">Sagittarius</term>. The <term id="10thhouse">10th house</term> of <term id="d10">D10</term> is <term id="virgo">Virgo</term>, which is ruled by <term id="mercury">Mercury</term>. Here, <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> is **exalted** in <term id="virgo">Virgo</term>, forming a powerful <term id="bhadrayoga">Bhadra Yoga</term> (a type of <term id="panchamahapurusha">Pancha Mahapurusha</term> Yoga if <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> is in <term id="kendra">Kendra</term> in <term id="d1">D1</term>, though not explicitly listed as such in this JSON). This placement confirms exceptional intelligence, analytical skills, and strong communication abilities. With <term id="rahu">Rahu</term> also in the <term id="10thhouse">10th house</term> of <term id="d10">D10</term>, your career is likely to involve advanced technology, foreign associations, or unconventional, cutting-edge fields. The exalted <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> in <term id="d10">D10</term> is a prime indicator of high professional distinction and intellectual mastery.

**2. The Master Clock (Vimshottari)**
You are currently in your <term id="saturn">Saturn</term> <term id="mahadasha">Mahadasha</term> (active until November 2030), with the <term id="antardasha">Antardasha</term> of <term id="rahu">Rahu</term> (June 2025 to May 2028).
<term id="saturn">Saturn</term> as your <term id="atmakaraka">Atmakaraka</term> and <term id="7thlord">7th lord</term> and <term id="8thlord">8th lord</term> is in your <term id="2ndhouse">2nd house</term> (<term id="leo">Leo</term>). <term id="rahu">Rahu</term> is also in the <term id="2ndhouse">2nd house</term> with <term id="saturn">Saturn</term>. This period is highly significant for transformation and growth related to wealth, family, and public image. The influence of <term id="rahu">Rahu</term> suggests that gains and changes may come through unconventional means, foreign connections, or innovative approaches. It's a period that demands discipline and hard work but promises substantial rewards and a clear focus on long-term goals.

**3. Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)**
This timing is confirmed by the **Aquarius** <term id="chara">Chara</term> <term id="dasha">Dasha</term> (active until April 2026) and **Ulka** (<term id="saturn">Saturn</term>) <term id="yogini">Yogini</term> (until July 2026), creating a period of intensive effort and karmic transformation in your career. The <term id="aquarius">Aquarius</term> <term id="chara">Chara</term> <term id="dasha">Dasha</term> activates your <term id="8thhouse">8th house</term>, which houses your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> <term id="mercury">Mercury</term>, indicating a period of profound research, discovery, or engagement with hidden aspects of your profession.
Following this, the **Capricorn** <term id="chara">Chara</term> <term id="dasha">Dasha</term> (from April 2026 to April 2031) and **Siddha** (<term id="venus">Venus</term>) <term id="yogini">Yogini</term> (from July 2026 to June 2027) will bring about more auspiciousness, ease, and significant success in partnerships and public life, leading to the full manifestation of your career aspirations.

**4. The Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)**
Your career potential from three perspectives:
-   **From <term id="lagna">Lagna</term> (<term id="cancer">Cancer</term>):** The <term id="10thhouse">10th house</term> is <term id="aries">Aries</term>, ruled by <term id="mars">Mars</term>, situated in the <term id="2ndhouse">2nd house</term> with <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term>, <term id="saturn">Saturn</term>, and <term id="rahu">Rahu</term>. This indicates a career driven by ambition and a strong desire for wealth and influence, demanding significant effort but promising financial gains and respect.
-   **From <term id="chandra">Chandra</term> <term id="lagna">Lagna</term> (<term id="moon">Moon</term> in <term id="libra">Libra</term>):** The <term id="10thhouse">10th house</term> from <term id="moon">Moon</term> is <term id="cancer">Cancer</term>, ruled by <term id="moon">Moon</term> itself, positioned in the <term id="4thhouse">4th house</term> from your <term id="lagna">Lagna</term>. This suggests a career deeply connected to your emotional well-being and possibly involving public interaction, nurturing, or establishing a strong base. It reflects a desire for a stable and fulfilling work life.
-   **From <term id="surya">Surya</term> <term id="lagna">Lagna</term> (<term id="sun">Sun</term> in <term id="pisces">Pisces</term>):** The <term id="10thhouse">10th house</term> from <term id="sun">Sun</term> is <term id="sagittarius">Sagittarius</term>, ruled by <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term>, which is in the <term id="2ndhouse">2nd house</term> from your <term id="lagna">Lagna</term>. This perspective emphasizes a career path that brings authority, wisdom, and recognition, often in advisory, teaching, or leadership roles where your knowledge is highly valued.

Since this strong career potential appears in **3 out of 3 charts** (<term id="lagna">Lagna</term>/<term id="moon">Moon</term>/<term id="sun">Sun</term>), the confidence level is 95% - expect a major life milestone in your professional journey.

**5. Nadi Precision (The Nature of Career)**
Your chart reveals specific <term id="nadi">Nadi</term> connections that define the exact nature of your career. While explicit <term id="nadi">Nadi</term> links for Saturn are not provided in the data, the placement of <term id="saturn">Saturn</term> (the <term id="karaka">Karaka</term> for career) with <term id="mars">Mars</term> and <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> in <term id="leo">Leo</term> in the <term id="2ndhouse">2nd house</term> suggests a career path demanding significant technical skill, leadership, and a strong sense of purpose. This combination would typically indicate success in managing large projects, technical innovation, or roles that require both strategic vision and practical implementation.

**6. The Micro-Timing (Yogini Confirmation)**
Your <term id="vimshottari">Vimshottari</term> <term id="dasha">Dasha</term> of <term id="saturn">Saturn</term>-<term id="rahu">Rahu</term> points to significant career changes and growth, potentially through unconventional means. This is further nuanced by the <term id="yogini">Yogini</term> <term id="dasha">Dasha</term>. The current <term id="bhadrika">Bhadrika</term> (<term id="mercury">Mercury</term>) <term id="mahadasha">Mahadasha</term> (until Dec 2029) is generally auspicious for career growth and social status. However, the <term id="ulka">Ulka</term> (<term id="saturn">Saturn</term>) <term id="antardasha">Antardasha</term> (until July 2026) indicates a period requiring intense hard work, discipline, and perhaps dealing with sudden shifts or increased responsibilities. Following this, the <term id="siddha">Siddha</term> (<term id="venus">Venus</term>) <term id="antardasha">Antardasha</term> (July 2026 to June 2027) promises smoother sailing, with success, auspiciousness, and ease, indicating that your hard work will pay off, leading to recognition and potential luxury.

**7. The Synthesis (D1 vs. D9)**
Your <term id="d1">D1</term> chart shows a formidable planetary grouping in your <term id="2ndhouse">2nd house</term>, including your <term id="10thlord">10th lord</term> <term id="mars">Mars</term>, <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term>, <term id="saturn">Saturn</term>, and <term id="rahu">Rahu</term>. While this promises a powerful career focused on wealth and authority, the presence of multiple <term id="planets">planets</term> in <term id="planetarywars">planetary wars</term> (especially <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> and <term id="saturn">Saturn</term> being prominent losers) in the initial years might have presented internal conflicts or challenges in expressing these energies smoothly. However, your <term id="d9">D9</term> <term id="navamsa">Navamsa</term> provides strong internal support. Your <term id="10thlord">10th lord</term> <term id="mars">Mars</term> is in its own sign <term id="aries">Aries</term> in the <term id="d9">D9</term> <term id="2ndhouse">2nd house</term>, signifying immense inner strength, courage, and self-reliance to overcome obstacles and achieve financial success. This combination of strong <term id="d1">D1</term> potential with robust <term id="d9">D9</term> strength means that any initial struggles or periods of intense effort will ultimately lead to enduring success and personal fulfillment in your professional life.

**8. Karmic Triggers (Progressive Nadi Transits)**
This period from 2025 to 2027 is a highly activated karmic phase for your career:
-   **Saturn triggers natal Mercury - Communication Mastery:** From **January 2025** for 2.5 years, <term id="saturn">Saturn</term> will trigger your natal <term id="mercury">Mercury</term> in the <term id="8thhouse">8th house</term>. This is a period of intense learning, deep research, and mastering complex communication. Expect significant developments in writing, public speaking, or specialized technical communication, permanently altering your intellectual and professional approach.
-   **Saturn triggers natal Sun - Authority Transformation:** From **April 2025** for 2.5 years, <term id="saturn">Saturn</term> will trigger your natal <term id="sun">Sun</term> in the <term id="9thhouse">9th house</term>. This is a potent period for significant transformation in your authority, leadership roles, and public image. You may experience a shift in your position, take on greater responsibilities, or redefine your relationship with mentors and higher management.
-   **Jupiter triggers natal Mars, Jupiter, Saturn - Structured Growth:** From **November 2026 to November 2027**, <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term> will trigger your natal <term id="mars">Mars</term>, <term id="jupiter">Jupiter</term>, and <term id="saturn">Saturn</term> in the <term id="2ndhouse">2nd house</term>. This alignment indicates a year of structured growth, righteous action, and significant expansion in wealth, responsibilities, and influence.

        Current question: "What are my strengths and weaknesses?"
        
        CRITICAL: If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
        - Extract the area from the user's response
        - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
        - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny

        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2027

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
        {
            "status": "CLARIFY" or "READY",
            "clarification_question": "Your clarifying question here (only if status=CLARIFY)",
            "extracted_context": {"timeframe": "2025", "aspect": "promotion"},

                }
            }
        }

        EXAMPLES (use these to identify similar patterns):
        
        Question: "How is my 2026?"
