Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: What are my health vulnerabilities?
Q: Direction
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your career is currently at a "Karmic Peak" where your professional skills (AI and Coding) are merging with your soul's research (Astrology). According to **Jaimini Sutras**, you are in the **Aquarius** <term id="chara-dasha">Chara Dasha</term> (8th House), which contains your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (Career Significator) **Mercury**. This specifically explains your transition into Astrology and AI. While the 10th house (Career) shows strong <term id="ashtakavarga">Ashtakavarga</term> support of **29 points**, your current <term id="mahadasha">Mahadasha</term> and <term id="antardasha">Antardasha</term> lords (Saturn and Rahu) are sitting in the 2nd House with only **25 points**, indicating that while your "Work" is highly advanced, the "Financial and Health stability" is currently the bottleneck.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The Jaimini Secret**: Your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (Mercury) is in the 8th house of <term id="aquarius">Aquarius</term>. According to **Jataka Parijata**, this indicates success through research, hidden knowledge, and technical analysis—perfectly aligning with your current focus on AI and Astrology.
• **Technical Mastery**: The **Sani-Karma Yoga** (Saturn + Mars) in your chart, cited in **Hora Sara**, gives you the structural discipline required for high-level coding and the logical framework for Vedic calculations.
• **Nadi Age Trigger**: At age 45-46, your chart activates the **Magha** and **Swati** <term id="nakshatra">Nakshatras</term>. Since Magha contains your 10th Lord (Mars) and Swati contains your Lagna Lord (Moon), this is a destined "Life Pivot" year for your professional identity.

### Astrological Analysis
The synthesis of your current dashas confirms that your career is not just "work," but a karmic obligation you are fulfilling through research.

#### The Parashari View
According to **BPHS**, your 10th Lord (Mars) is in the 2nd House, creating a **Dhana Yoga** (Wealth Yoga). However, Mars is joined by Saturn, Rahu, and Jupiter in <term id="leo">Leo</term>. This cluster creates high technical competence but also "Burnout" energy. The 10th house (<term id="aries">Aries</term>) has **29 points** in <term id="ashtakavarga">Ashtakavarga</term>, showing consistent career strength. Your 11th house (<term id="taurus">Taurus</term>) has **31 points**, which is excellent for gains through your specialized network. The struggle you feel is because the current dasha lords occupy the 2nd house, which only has **25 points**, meaning the "rewards" feel slower than the "effort" put in.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
Your career trajectory is governed by the <term id="aquarius">Aquarius</term> Chara Dasha. Based on **Jaimini Sutras**, Aquarius (ID 10) aspects:
1.  **Cancer (ID 3)**: Your 1st House (Self)
2.  **Aries (ID 0)**: Your 10th House (Career)
3.  **Libra (ID 6)**: Your 4th House (Home/Happiness)

This means the current period *directly* activates your 10th house of career. Because your **Amatyakaraka** (Mercury) is in this sign, the "8th House" energy (research, occult, AI coding) is not just a distraction—it is your **primary professional path** for this period. 

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of AI & Astrology)
Your chart reveals specific **Nadi** connections that define your career:
- **The "Technical Master" Link (Saturn + Mars + Rahu):** This Nadi link specifically points to high-level technical infrastructure and "Shadow Logic" (AI/Coding). 
- **The "Dharma-Karma" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** This indicates that your work must have a philosophical or advisory component, which is why you have gravitated toward Astrology.
- **Nadi Age Trigger**: Age 46 activates **Magha**. In your chart, Magha contains a cluster of **Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu**. This indicates a massive "Karmic Wake-up Call" regarding your career direction—expect a significant breakthrough or a structural shift in how you work by the end of 2026.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
Your career timing is currently governed by a complex intersection:
1.  **Vimshottari**: You are in **Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter**. Saturn and Rahu provide the technical/AI drive, while the <term id="pratyantardasha">Pratyantardasha</term> of **Jupiter**, sitting in your **2nd House**, brings the wisdom of Astrology.
2.  **Chara Dasha**: Running **Aquarius**, which activates your career axis (Aries).
3.  **Yogini Dasha**: You are in **Bhadrika (Mercury)** MD and **Ulka (Saturn)** AD. **Mercury** as MD lord confirms the focus on coding and commerce, while **Ulka** brings heavy workload and potential health-related labor.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
- **From Lagna**: 10th house contains **Gulika**, indicating technical troubleshooting and initial hurdles.
- **From Moon**: 10th house is **Cancer**, containing no planets but ruled by Moon in the 1st (from Moon), showing self-employment potential.
- **From Sun**: 10th house is **Sagittarius**, containing **Moon** and **Saturn** in D9, promising authority through specialized knowledge.
Since career stability appears in **2 out of 3** charts, the confidence level is **66%**—you will achieve success, but the physical stress (health) is the primary obstacle to consistency.

#### Special Points (Gandanta & Yogi)
- **Gandanta Alert**: Your **Lagna** is at 29.88° Cancer (Ashlesha-Magha junction), and **Mars** (10th Lord) is at 2.39° Leo. This "Gandanta" placement means your career involves "knotty" problems that others cannot solve. It also indicates that your professional life undergoes radical "re-births."
- **Yogi Point**: Your Yogi Lord is **Mercury** (AmK). Since Mercury is your fortune-bringer and is currently activated in Chara Dasha, your move into Astrology/AI is your most "fortunate" path, despite the pressure.

### Nakshatra Insights
• **Saturn in Uttara Phalguni**: Your career Lord is in a nakshatra ruled by **Aryaman** (the god of patronage). **Phaladeepika** states this grants success through helping others.
• **Mercury in Purva Bhadrapada**: This nakshatra is associated with "two-faced" logic (binary/coding) and spiritual intensity. It explains the dual nature of your AI and Astrology work.
• **Navatara Warning**: **Saturn** is currently transiting in **Uttara Bhadrapada**, which is your **Vipat Tara** (Danger/Obstacle) from your birth Moon in Swati. This creates the "Health vs Career" friction you are experiencing. Even though you are doing the right work, the transit creates physical obstacles.

### Timing & Guidance
🎯 **Precision Date**: On **October 31, 2026**, your Sudarshana Year-Clock conjuncts your natal **Jupiter**. This is a **Single Confirmation** "Day of Grace" for your career—watch for a major opportunity or recognition on this day.

**Practical Remedy for the 8th House Energy**:
To manage the 8th house pressure and Ketu's <term id="mrityu-bhaga">Mrityu Bhaga</term> position (4° Aquarius):
1.  **Biological**: Plant a **Shami** tree or keep Shami wood to ground Ketu's chaotic energy in your research.
2.  **Sound**: Chant **"Om Namo Bhagavate Varahadevaya"** to stabilize the 2/8 axis.
3.  **Ritual**: Donate **Black Sesame** and **Lead** on Saturdays to appease the Vipat Tara Saturn.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your transition into Astrology and AI is the perfect "energy expenditure" for your 8th house activation. You are not "wasting" energy; you are transmuting it. As per **Saravali**, the presence of the 10th lord in a Maraka house suggests that your career will always be linked to your physical vitality—manage your health, and the career will soar.</div>
Q: What does my birth chart say about my career?
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: Your health concerns are reaching a peak now because of a rare "Triple Maraka-Dusthana Concentration." You are currently running the **Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter** <term id="vimshottari">Vimshottari Dasha</term>. All three planets are clustered in your 2nd House (<term id="leo">Leo</term>), which **BPHS** defines as a <term id="maraka">Maraka</term> (Killer/Stress-inflicting) house. Specifically, your current <term id="pratyantardasha">Pratyantardasha</term> lord, **Jupiter**, rules your 6th house of illness and sits in the 2nd, acting as a functional trigger for physical vulnerability. Simultaneously, your <term id="chara-dasha">Chara Dasha</term> has transitioned into **Aquarius** (your 8th house of chronic issues), which holds only **22 <term id="ashtakavarga">Ashtakavarga</term> points**—the weakest house in your entire chart. 

Regarding your work in **Astrology and AI coding**, you are instinctively performing "Karmic Remediation." Your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> (Mercury) sits in the 8th house (<term id="aquarius">Aquarius</term>). By engaging in 8th-house activities (occult research and deep-tech/AI), you are "spending" the transformative energy of this house through your mind and career, which significantly mitigates the severity of potential health crises. However, because the 8th house lacks structural strength (low points), the physical body still feels the "heat" of this intense intellectual labor.</div>

### Key Insights
• **The 8th House Alchemist**: Your <term id="amatyakaraka">Amatyakaraka</term> Mercury in the 8th house suggests that your soul finds its professional purpose through deep research and unconventional knowledge. Using AI and Astrology is the highest manifestation of this placement.
• **Maraka Overload**: The cluster of Saturn, Rahu, and Jupiter in the 2nd house (Leo) puts extreme pressure on the "physical sustenance" area of life.
• **Classical Verdict**: According to **Saravali**, a cluster of four planets in one house (including Mars in your 2nd) creates intense focus but subjects the native to physical fatigue and mental restlessness.

### Astrological Analysis
The current period is a "Destiny Trigger" where your natal potential is meeting specific timing windows that demand a physical and professional pivot.

#### The Parashari View
From the perspective of your Cancer <term id="lagna">Lagna</term>, your 2nd house (<term id="leo">Leo</term>) is under a massive siege. It contains the 7th/8th lord (Saturn), the 6th lord (Jupiter), and the 10th lord (Mars), along with Rahu. While this creates a powerful <term id="raj-yoga">Raj Yoga</term> for status (connecting 5th, 7th, 9th, and 10th lords), it also turns the 2nd house into a furnace of Maraka energy. **The Ashtakavarga shows 25 points for this house**, indicating moderate support—not enough to fully insulate you from the strain of four heavy-duty planets.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
According to the **Jaimini Sutras**, your current **Aquarius Chara Dasha** (8th House) is the primary reason health is a concern. **Aquarius aspects Aries, Cancer, and Libra** (Sign IDs 0, 3, 6) according to the `sign_aspects` mapping. This means the 8th house energy is directly aspecting your 1st house (Cancer - the body). 
*   **Wealth Perspective**: Benefics Mercury and Ketu sit in the 2nd from your <term id="arudha-lagna">Arudha Lagna</term> (Capricorn), confirming that your earnings from AI and Astrology are stable despite the health stress.
*   **The UL Check**: Your <term id="upapada-lagna">Upapada Lagna</term> (UL) is in Taurus with 30 points, providing a "grounding" influence through your home life that prevents a total health breakdown.

#### Nadi Precision (AI & Astrology)
Your chart contains the **Saturn + Rahu** link, which **Nadi** texts describe as "Foreign or Shadow Technology." In modern terms, this is the signature of **Artificial Intelligence** and advanced coding. 
*   **The Mercury Link**: Mercury (Coding/Logic) links to Saturn and Rahu, defining the nature of your work.
*   **The Jupiter + Ketu Link**: Jupiter (Wisdom) in trine to Ketu (Roots/Occult) is the classical "Astrologer's Link." 
*   **NADI AGE TRIGGER**: At age 46 (starting April 2026), you activate the **Swati and Magha** nakshatras. Your Moon is in Swati (4th house), and your cluster of Mars, Jupiter, and Rahu is in Magha (2nd house). This year is a "Karmic Wake-up Call" where these planets MUST manifest their results—meaning your AI/Astrology work will likely reach a major milestone, but only if you manage the physical "Magha" heat.

#### Timing Synthesis
This period is uniquely intense due to the convergence of three systems:
1.  **Vimshottari**: Saturn-Rahu-Jupiter. Jupiter is your PD lord sitting in the 2nd house.
2.  **Chara**: Aquarius Mahadasha/Antardasha (8th House activation).
3.  **Yogini**: You are in the **Mercury (Bhadrika)** Mahadasha but the **Saturn (Ulka)** Antardasha. **Phaladeepika** notes that the Ulka vibe brings "labor and mental grief."
*   **Precision Trigger**: Your **Sudarshana Year-Clock** is currently in your 10th house (Aries), which holds 29 SAV points. This confirms that while health (2nd/8th axis) is struggling, your Career (10th house) is actually in a growth phase.

#### Special Points (Gandanta & MB Ketu)
*   **KARMIC LANDMINE**: Your natal **Ketu at 3.42° Aquarius** falls on the **Mrityu Bhaga (Death Degree)** with a strong 0.58° orb. According to **Uttara Kalamrita**, Ketu in the 8th on this degree acts like a "wounded soldier." It cannot protect your 8th house significations. This is why you feel physically vulnerable—the 8th house "shield" has a hole in it.
*   **Gandanta Analysis**: Your **Lagna** and **Mars** are in the **Ashlesha-Magha Gandanta** (Extreme intensity). This junction between water and fire signs often causes a feeling of "burning out" or being caught between two worlds.

#### Divisional Chart Analysis (D30 & D10)
*   **D30 (Trimsamsa)**: In the chart of misfortunes, Saturn is **Exalted in the 12th house**, and Mars is in its **Moolatrikona in the 6th**. This indicates that you are a "fighter" against chronic issues, but the battle is exhausting.
*   **D10 (Dasamsa)**: Your Sun, Moon, and Saturn are all in the 10th house of D10 (<term id="sagittarius">Sagittarius</term>). This is a massive "Power Cluster," ensuring that your work in AI and Astrology will lead to high status and authority, provided you survive the "D1 health siege."

### Nakshatra Insights
• **Swati (Moon)**: Governed by Vayu (Wind). Your mind is fast and scattered (AI coding). Use the **Pradhvamsa Shakti** (Power to scatter) to scatter your stress through meditation.
• **Magha (Mars/Jupiter/Rahu Cluster)**: This is your **Nadi Age Trigger** for 2026. Magha is ruled by the Pitris (Ancestors). Your current health concerns may have an ancestral or genetic root that requires "cooling" remedies.

### Timing & Guidance
The period until **July 2026** (end of Ulka Yogini) requires high management. You are not "doomed," but you are running on an "empty tank" because the 8th house has only 22 points.

**Recommended Remedies (Classical Upaya)**:
1.  **Biological**: Plant or nurture a **Banyan tree** (Magha Vriksha) to stabilize the 2nd house cluster.
2.  **Ritual**: Perform **Pitru Tarpan** (Ancestral offerings) to pacify the Magha planets causing the health heat.
3.  **Sound**: For the MB-afflicted Ketu, chant the Beej Mantra **'Om Am/Im'** 108 times, focusing on the vibration **'Ge'**.
4.  **Activity**: Continue the AI and Astrology coding. It is your "Dharma-Meghara" (Shield of Dharma). It absorbs the 8th-house toxins that would otherwise settle in your physical organs.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: Your health concern is a "Karmic Tax" for the high-intensity professional growth you are experiencing. By converting 8th-house vulnerability into 8th-house knowledge (AI/Astrology), you are following the highest path suggested by **Jataka Parijata**. The physical body is currently the "sacrificial altar" for your intellectual evolution.</div>

        

KNOWN USER BACKGROUND:
- CAREER: Work in Astrology and AI coding, Doing a lot of astrology and AI coding, Employed
- HEALTH: Health is a concern, health

IMPORTANT: Do NOT ask for information already present in the user background.

        
        
        🚨🚨🚨 BLOCKING RULE - READ THIS FIRST 🚨🚨🚨
        Before generating ANY clarification question, you MUST:
        1. Read the "KNOWN USER BACKGROUND" section above
        2. Check if the information you want to ask is ALREADY THERE
        3. If it IS there, DO NOT ask for it - skip to asking about the specific aspect instead
        
        Example: User background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon as a Senior Software Development Manager"
        ❌ WRONG: "Are you currently employed or running a business?"
        ✅ CORRECT: "What specific aspect of your career would you like to explore - promotion timing, salary growth, job change, or career direction?"
        
        Current question: "What are my health vulnerabilities?"
        
        CRITICAL FOLLOW-UP DETECTION:
        1. If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a FULL ANSWER (not a clarification question), and the current user message is:
           - A correction ("that's wrong", "incorrect", "planet position is wrong")
           - A follow-up ("tell me more", "what about...", "and...")
           - A clarification request ("what do you mean", "explain")
           - A short response referring to previous context ("yes", "no", "okay", single words)
           Then: Return status: "READY" immediately WITHOUT asking clarification. This is a continuation of the previous conversation.
        
        2. If the PREVIOUS assistant message was a clarification question asking which area to focus on, and the current user message is answering that (e.g., "career", "about my career", "health"), then:
           - Extract the area from the user's response
           - Return status: "READY" with the extracted category
           - Combine the original question context with the user's clarification response
        
        DIVISIONAL CHART DETECTION:
        Based on the question topic, determine which divisional charts are needed:
        - D1 (Rashi): Always include for basic analysis
        - D3 (Drekkana): Siblings, courage, communication, short travels
        - D4 (Chaturthamsa): Property, home, mother, education, vehicles
        - D7 (Saptamsa): Children, creativity, progeny
        - D9 (Navamsa): Marriage, spouse, dharma, spiritual strength (always include)
        - D10 (Dasamsa): Career, profession, reputation, father
        - D12 (Dwadasamsa): Parents, ancestry, past life
        - D16 (Shodasamsa): Vehicles, happiness, luxuries
        - D20 (Vimsamsa): Spirituality, religious practices
        - D24 (Chaturvimsamsa): Education, learning, knowledge
        - D27 (Nakshatramsa): Strengths, weaknesses, general fortune
        - D30 (Trimsamsa): Misfortunes, diseases, enemies
        - D40 (Khavedamsa): Maternal relatives, auspicious/inauspicious events
        - D45 (Akshavedamsa): Character, conduct, general behavior
        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. When clarification is needed, craft a natural, conversational question that:
           
           🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS check the KNOWN USER BACKGROUND section first.
           - DO NOT ask for information already present in the user background
           - Example: If background shows "CAREER: Employed in Amazon", skip asking about employment status
           - Example: If background shows "FAMILY: Married in 2020", skip asking about marital status
           
           Your clarification question should:
           - Focus on narrowing down the SPECIFIC aspect they want to know (timing, prospects, challenges, etc.)
           - Gather NEW factual information NOT in the user background
           - Sound warm, natural, and conversational (not templated)
           - Be tailored to their exact question
           - Help you provide a more accurate astrological analysis
           
           💡 FACT EXTRACTION BONUS:
           The MORE specific facts you can extract in your clarification question, the BETTER our future responses will be.
           - Instead of just asking "What aspect?", try to extract concrete details
           - Examples of valuable facts: specific job titles, company names, years of experience, number of children, ages, education levels, health conditions, locations, dates of major events
           - These facts will be stored and used to personalize ALL future astrological guidance for this user
        
        4. 🚨 ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM: 1 clarification per conversation - NO EXCEPTIONS
           - After 1 clarification, you MUST return status: "READY" regardless of information completeness
           - The clarification_count parameter tracks how many you've already asked
           - If clarification_count >= 1, you are FORBIDDEN from asking another question
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Questions involving 'when', 'growth', or 'timing' → ALWAYS set needs_transits: true
        - Career questions about promotions/hikes → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
