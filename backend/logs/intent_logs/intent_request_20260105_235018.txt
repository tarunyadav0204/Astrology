A: How will be my finances in 2026. Give detailed answer about my finances from all aspects.
Q: What are my health vulnerabilities? What problems I may face in 2026 related to health.
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The year 2026 brings a **high-voltage financial transformation**, driven by the intense **Saturn-Rahu** period activating your 2nd House of accumulated wealth. Specifically, expect a shift from financial stress to significant liquidity between **July and October 2026**, as the **Siddha (Venus)** Yogini Dasha activates your 11th House of gains. However, your D9 Mars (in own sign Aries) creates a "protective fortress" around your assets, ensuring that despite high expenses, your net worth grows. **Action:** Implement a strict "lock-in" strategy for savings before **May 2026** to prevent the 12th House from draining your inflows.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Wealth Cluster" Paradox:** Your 2nd House (Leo) contains four heavyweights—Saturn, Rahu, Jupiter, and Mars. This creates massive energy for accumulation but also volatility. Money comes in bursts (Rahu) rather than a steady trickle.
*   **Income vs. Savings:** Your **11th House (Income)** is powerful with Venus in its own sign (Taurus) and 31 Ashtakavarga points (Excellent). However, your **12th House (Expenses)** has 35 points (Very High). You are a "High Earner, High Spender" by design in 2026.
*   **The Jaimini Secret:** Your **Indu Lagna** (Wealth Point) is in Pisces, occupied by the Sun. With Saturn transiting over this point in 2026, you are structurally solidifying your financial reputation.
*   **The July Pivot:** The first half of the year (Ulka Yogini) requires hard labor for money. The second half (Siddha Yogini) brings wealth through ease, networks, and liquid gains.

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View
Your chart features a rare **Quadruple Conjunction** in the 2nd House (Leo):
*   **Saturn (7th/8th Lord):** Delays savings but promises inheritance or partner's wealth.
*   **Rahu:** Amplifies desire for wealth; brings money from foreign or unconventional sources.
*   **Jupiter (6th/9th Lord):** Expands wealth but through solving problems or litigation (6th connection).
*   **Mars (5th/10th Lord):** The **Yogakaraka** in the house of wealth creates a *Dhana Yoga*—career success directly translates to bank balance.
*   **The Conflict:** The **Mars-Rahu** conjunction (Angarak Yoga) in the wealth house creates an impulse to spend aggressively or take risky bets.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive
*   **Arudha Lagna (AL) Analysis:** Your AL is in **Capricorn**. The 2nd from AL is **Aquarius**, containing Mercury and Ketu. This indicates that your financial status may face a temporary "break" or restructuring (Ketu) before stabilizing.
*   **Hora Lagna (HL):** HL is in **Aries**. Mars, the lord of HL, is in the 2nd house of wealth. This is a classic *Dhana Yoga*—the source of wealth (HL) is sitting in the house of accumulated wealth.
*   **Chara Dasha Verdict:** You enter the **Capricorn** Chara Dasha in April 2026.
    *   The **Amatyakaraka (Mercury)** falls in the 2nd house from Capricorn (Aquarius).
    *   **Rule:** When the Career Planet (AmK) is in the 2nd house from the Dasha Lagna, it promises **financial rise through professional status**.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Wealth)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi connections that define the exact nature of your wealth in 2026:

*   **The "Shadow Wealth" Link (Saturn + Rahu):** This combination in your 2nd house indicates wealth coming from **foreign currencies, digital assets, AI/Tech sectors**, or "hidden" sources. It is not "salary" money; it is "deal" money.
*   **The "Dharma-Karma" Link (Saturn + Jupiter):** This ensures that despite the chaos of Rahu, your wealth has a foundation in legitimate, respectable advisory or management roles.
*   **The "Luxury" Link (Venus in Taurus):** Venus is unconnected to the malefics in the 2nd house. This isolation in the 11th house (Gains) suggests that your **incoming cash flow** remains pure and enjoyable, even if your **savings** (2nd house) are stressful to manage.

#### Timing Synthesis (Multi-System)
*   **Jan - June 2026 (Saturn-Rahu-Saturn/Mercury):**
    *   **Vimshottari:** Saturn-Rahu creates fluctuation.
    *   **Yogini:** **Ulka (Saturn)** indicates heavy workload and pressure on finances.
    *   **Prediction:** High expenses, feeling "cash-poor" despite assets.
*   **July - Dec 2026 (Saturn-Rahu-Venus):**
    *   **Vimshottari:** Prana dasha of Venus enters.
    *   **Yogini:** Shift to **Siddha (Venus)**.
    *   **Prediction:** The "Golden Window." Venus activates the 11th house. Inflows increase, investments pay off, and liquidity issues resolve.
*   **October 31, 2026 (The Karmic Trigger):**
    *   **Event:** Jupiter transits into Leo, triggering your natal Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
    *   **Prediction:** A massive financial event—likely a property purchase, a huge bonus, or a successful exit from an investment. This is the peak wealth moment of the year.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **From Lagna (Cancer):** The Wealth Cluster is in the **2nd House** (Accumulation/Family). Focus is on *saving*.
*   **From Moon (Libra):** The Wealth Cluster falls in the **11th House** (Gains). This is spectacular. Mentally, you will feel successful and see high inflows.
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** The Wealth Cluster falls in the **6th House** (Debts/Service).
*   **Verdict:** Since 2 out of 3 charts (Lagna/Moon) show wealth (2nd/11th connection), the confidence is **High (85%)**. However, the Sun's position warns that this wealth may come with a temporary debt or service obligation.

### Nakshatra Insights
*   **Saturn (Mahadasha Lord) in Purva Ashadha:** Ruled by Venus (Water). This suggests wealth through fluidity—consulting, liquids, or trading. It warns against stubbornness in financial negotiations.
*   **Rahu (Antardasha Lord) in Magha:** Ruled by Ketu/Ancestors. This often brings **legacy wealth** or money from past connections/past efforts suddenly bearing fruit.
*   **Venus (Wealth Lord) in Krittika:** Ruled by the Sun. This indicates "sharp" or "cutting" wealth—money from decisive actions, audits, or leadership roles.

### Timing & Guidance
*   **Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar):** **Conserve.** High 12th house influence suggests unexpected expenses. Avoid new loans.
*   **Q2 2026 (Apr-Jun):** **Plan.** As you shift into Capricorn Chara Dasha, restructure your portfolio.
*   **Q3 2026 (Jul-Sep):** **Harvest.** The Siddha (Venus) period begins. Aggressively push for raises, close deals, or book profits.
*   **Q4 2026 (Oct-Dec):** **Invest.** The Jupiter transit trigger in late October is the time to lock wealth into tangible assets (property/gold) to pacify the Mars-Rahu energy.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: 2026 is not a year of "steady salary"—it is a year of **financial restructuring**. You have a "Leakage" problem (12th House) rather than an "Income" problem (11th House). If you can plug the expenses in the first half of the year, the second half promises a significant elevation in your net worth, potentially through a single major event in late October.</div>
Q: Tell me about may married life relationship in 2026. How will it remain in general.
A: <div class="quick-answer-card">**Quick Answer**: The year 2026, driven by the **Saturn-Rahu** Dasha, highlights a period of high sensitivity for your **Throat, Teeth, and Digestion** (2nd House areas). Specifically, the transit of Ketu over your natal planetary cluster in Leo suggests inflammation or dental/ENT issues between **January and October 2026**. However, your D9 Mars (strong in Aries) ensures your vitality and recovery speed remain excellent. Focus on an **anti-inflammatory diet** and schedule a preventative dental/ENT checkup immediately.</div>

### Key Insights
*   **The "Cluster" Activation**: Your 2nd House (Leo) contains four planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu). In 2026, the node **Ketu** will transit directly through this sign. This "karmic crossing" often triggers sudden inflammation or sensitivity in the face, throat, or neck area.
*   **The "Triple" Confirmation**: The health vulnerability is confirmed from all three angles—Lagna (Cancer), Moon (Libra), and Sun (Pisces)—making it a high-probability event requiring management, not fear.
*   **The Jaimini Warning**: Your Chara Dasha shifts to **Capricorn** in April 2026. From the perspective of Capricorn, your massive planetary cluster falls in the **8th House** (Transformation/Chronic issues), signaling the need for extra caution in the second half of the year.
*   **Strength Factor**: Despite these sensitivities, your **Mars is in its own sign (Aries)** in the D9 Navamsa. This is a "Warrior Configuration," meaning your body fights infection and recovers from illness much faster than average.

### Astrological Analysis

#### The Parashari View (The Root)
Your chart features a heavy concentration of energy in the **2nd House (Leo)**, containing the 6th Lord (Jupiter - Diseases) and the 8th Lord (Saturn - Chronic issues).
*   **The Vulnerability:** The 2nd House rules the **face, mouth, teeth, throat, and right eye**. The presence of Saturn and Rahu here creates a "Vata-Pitta" imbalance—prone to dryness, tooth aches, or acid reflux.
*   **The Trigger (2026):** You are running the **Saturn-Rahu** Vimshottari Dasha. Since both planets sit in this 2nd House cluster, the dasha activates this specific vulnerability. Rahu typically brings "hard-to-diagnose" sensitivities or allergies.

#### Jaimini Sutra Deep-Dive (The Timing)
*   **Chara Dasha Shift:** On **April 2, 2026**, your major period shifts from Aquarius to **Capricorn**.
*   **Relative Analysis:** Treat Capricorn as the Ascendant.
    *   Your natal cluster (Saturn/Mars/Rahu/Jupiter) is in **Leo**, which is the **8th House from Capricorn**.
    *   The 8th House represents sudden breaks, surgery, or acute pain.
    *   **Verdict:** The period *after* April 2026 requires more vigilance than the beginning of the year. The activation of the Atmakaraka (Saturn) in the 8th from the Dasha sign suggests stress-induced physical strain.

#### Nadi Precision (The Nature of Health)
Your chart reveals specific Nadi links that define the *type* of health issues:
*   **Saturn + Rahu Link:** This combination creates "Vata" disturbance. It often manifests as **gastric trouble, bloating, or anxiety-related palpitations**.
*   **Mars + Ketu Transit:** As transit Ketu crosses natal Mars (in 2026), it creates a "Pitta" spike. This specifically indicates **inflammation, heat, fevers, or cuts/injuries** rather than cold/sluggish diseases.

#### Timing Synthesis
*   **Critical Window:** The convergence of the **Saturn-Rahu Dasha** and the **Ketu Transit in Leo** peaks between **March and July 2026**.
*   **Yogini Confirmation:** You are under **Ulka (Saturn)** Antardasha until July 2026. Ulka is associated with physical labor and exhaustion. The combined Saturn influence (Vimshottari + Yogini) confirms that rest and stress management are your best medicines this year.

#### Triple Perspective (Sudarshana)
*   **From Lagna (Cancer):** The affliction is in the **2nd House** (Throat/Mouth).
*   **From Moon (Libra):** The cluster is in the **11th House** (Shins/Ankles) – watch for minor injuries here.
*   **From Sun (Pisces):** The cluster is in the **6th House** (Disease/Gut).
*   **Verdict:** Since the affliction hits the **6th House from the Sun** (Source of Vitality), the confidence level is **95%** that gut health and digestion will be the primary driver of overall well-being in 2026.

### Nakshatra Insights
*   **Natal Saturn in Purva Ashadha:** This Nakshatra is ruled by Venus and relates to "water" and kidneys. Ensure you stay hydrated, as Saturn here can cause kidney stones or dehydration during stressful periods.
*   **Transit Ketu in Magha:** Ketu will transit **Magha Nakshatra** (in Leo) during early 2026. Magha rules the "heart" and genetic lineage. It suggests hereditary minor issues might flare up—check your family history for heart or blood pressure tendencies.

### Timing & Guidance
*   **Preventative Window (Jan - March 2026):** Get a full dental cleaning and an ENT checkup. The planetary focus on the 2nd house often brings neglected tooth issues to the surface.
*   **Dietary Adjustment:** Reduce spicy and acidic foods. The Rahu/Mars influence in Leo (Stomach) suggests **Acid Reflux** or **Ulcers** are the most likely manifestation if diet is ignored.
*   **Lifestyle:** Since Saturn rules your "longevity" and is currently activating your dasha, **discipline** is the remedy. Irregular sleep or eating habits will punish you immediately; routine will heal you.

<div class="final-thoughts-card">**Final Thoughts**: 2026 is not a year of "bad health," but rather a year of **"maintenance."** Your body is asking for attention to its intake system (Mouth/Stomach). By managing inflammation and keeping your dental/gut health in check, you will navigate the Saturn-Rahu period successfully.</div>

        - D60 (Shashtiamsa): General fortune, karmic patterns
        
        Examples:
        - "When will I get married?" → ["D1", "D9", "D7"]
        - "How is my career?" → ["D1", "D9", "D10"]
        - "Tell me about my siblings" → ["D1", "D3", "D9"]
        - "Property purchase timing?" → ["D1", "D4", "D9", "D12"]
        - "Children prospects?" → ["D1", "D7", "D9"]
        - "Health issues?" → ["D1", "D9", "D30"]
        - "Education/learning?" → ["D1", "D9", "D24"]
        - "Spiritual growth?" → ["D1", "D9", "D20"]
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR CLARIFICATION:
        
        1. ALWAYS return status: "CLARIFY" for these types of questions:
           - "Tell me about my [year]" (e.g., "Tell me about my 2026", "Tell me about next year")
           - "How is my [year]?" (e.g., "How is my 2026?", "How is next year?")
           - "What about [year]?" (e.g., "What about 2026?")
           - "Tell me about my [topic]" without specifics (e.g., "Tell me about my career", "Tell me about marriage")
           - "What about [topic]?" without specifics (e.g., "What about my health?")
           - Any question asking about a year/period WITHOUT mentioning a specific life area
        
        2. ONLY return status: "READY" when question has BOTH:
           - A specific life area (career, health, marriage, finance, etc.)
           - A clear focus or timeframe
           Examples: "When will I get married?", "Will I get promotion in 2025?", "How is my health in 2026?"
        
        3. Clarification questions should be CONTEXTUAL and help gather facts. Use these examples as inspiration:
           - "Tell me about my kids" → "I'd love to help! How many children do you have, and what specific aspect would you like to know - their education, health, career prospects, or timing of children if you're planning?"
           - "How is my 2026?" → "To provide the most accurate guidance, which area would you like me to focus on? Career, Health, Relationships, Finance, or another specific area?"
           - "Tell me about my career" → "I can help with that! Are you currently employed or running a business? And what specifically would you like to know - job change timing, promotion prospects, salary growth, or career direction?"
           - "What about my marriage" → "I'd be happy to analyze that! Are you currently married, engaged, or looking for marriage? And what aspect concerns you - timing, compatibility, challenges, or harmony?"
           
           Generate similar contextual questions that:
           - Gather factual information (number of kids, marital status, employment status, etc.)
           - Narrow down the specific concern within that topic
           - Sound warm and conversational, not robotic
           - Are tailored to the user's specific question
        
        4. Max 2 clarifications per session - after that, return READY with available info
        
        MODES:
        1. "annual": YEARLY forecasts, specific calendar years (e.g. "How is my 2026?", "What does next year hold?")
        2. "birth": General life analysis, personality, "When will..." timing questions (e.g. "When will I get married?", "What are my strengths?")

        TRANSIT DETECTION:
        - "When will..." questions → needs_transits: true
        - "What period is good for..." → needs_transits: true
        - "How is 2025/next year..." → needs_transits: true
        - "Marriage timing" → needs_transits: true
        - Personality/yoga/general questions → needs_transits: false

        CRITICAL: For ANY mode requiring transits, set startYear and endYear to ONLY the specific year/period mentioned in the question.
        - If question mentions "2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026
        - If question mentions "Q1 2026", use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2026, months: ["January", "February", "March"]
        - If question mentions "March-June 2025", use startYear: 2025, endYear: 2025, months: ["March", "April", "May", "June"]
        - If question mentions "next year", use startYear: 2027, endYear: 2027
        - For general timing questions without specific year, use startYear: 2026, endYear: 2028

        Return ONLY a JSON object:
